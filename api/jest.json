The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect. The AirPods Max are clearly designed to emulate the experience of AirPods, they don't have a powerbutton and are meant to be put back in the case after use, and then when removed from case are already connected to your device. They work well in that sense. Where it doesn't make sense though is that the 'smart' case you get is odd, it's not protective but it's also not small enough to pocket, so you end up buying a third party hard case for travelling and then for taking the headphones to work etc you don't take the smart case. The only positive is that the headphones left outside the case still go into their lower power states, but it's just slower to do so than it is in the case. Still, this is a very strange solution for a problem that would have been solved by just having a physical off button, as it is they drain a small amount of battery even if in the case. It feels like Apple being stubborn about maintaining the characteristics of 'AirPods' despite the over ear headphone category having different expectations. I have had issues with them being left a couple of days in the case and getting 'stuck' off and needing to be plugged in to 'revive' them, bizarre, and again, would have been solved with a physical power button. Overall however I like the sound quality and the fit and finish but think they only make sense for users who are 100% inside Apple's ecosystem.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"\\u00b7 Review provided by digitec.ch\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Great headphones! Just bear with nitpicky points\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"October 7, 2022\", \"content\": \"All the expectation surrounding the quality of these headphones was pleasantly met. If you are looking for clear and balanced sound, these fit the bill. They feel solid in your hands (and heavy on the head) but comfortable to wear (at least for me) for a few hours. Noise cancellation is better than my Sony XM4. Digital crown dial and secondary button does the trick to play, pause, and toggle ANC (Sony did spoil me with the tapping of headset to play/pause but it's fine) Spatial audio is mind blowing and the convenience to easily connect to any Apple device - including the Apple TV is how you're rewarded for being a part of their ecosystem. Sony's way to pair only two devices simultaneously comes at a cost of lower bitrate of music. And if paired with an iPhone, when people call me, they tell me I sound great with little background noise. It is a bit of a head scratcher that they don't support the higher quality bitrate of music that Apple Music has in their library. Also, charging by lightning cable instead of USB-C is also a selfish decision on their part but the battery life is great. If you have a really large head, make a hard pass onto something else. If you want skull crushing bass response, go elsewhere. The bra/purse/case to allow it to go into very low power mode is not very attractive in my opinion. Thankfully there are 3rd party cases that now do the same thing and it protects it better when thrown in the backpack for travel. I got these headphone at a great price due to price matching (Amazon), BB rewards cash back, and a gift certificate I got for my b-day. Took the price way down below $300 (and it came included with 2 years of AppleCare). Considering next gen APM should be announced this year, the price of this model should go down and make it even more suitable for purchase. I've used the APM for about a month.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SpinalTap \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"They sound better than you first think\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"April 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I think it should take a lot to get a real 5-star product review, and most of the time Apple can be close (depending on how much of their stuff you have to integrate with). I have and love the AirPod Pros for day-to-day with calls, music, audiobooks, and recently been using them on planes for work commuting more and more as the noise canceling is pretty good. I got these because they were on sale and my old pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I loved) were failing, so I figured I would buy these and worst case exchange for Sony headphones if these weren't worth the premium. I watched a lot of reviews, MKBHD had a review and I thought it seemed oversold on sound quality compared to what I thought was really good with the Sony options always, and I was initially underwhelmed and worried I would end up exchanging. Then I let them sit for a bit and settled in and used them for a day or two for my calls/video conferencing and music. I started to realize how much clarity I got without really losing anything. Instead of getting that punchy bass everywhere, you get bass that really acts as emphasis. Vocals are crystal clear. Mic quality is excellent. Comfort wise it is great over long periods. Noise canceling is at least as good (honestly seems better) than other headests I've had. Ambient mode is way better and doesn't have that harsh sound. Only knock on it is if you're doing anything active with them on I feel like the mesh cups do tend to absorb a bit more. The plastic backing makes it a little hard to clean but not impossible. They DO sell replacement ones, so I guess in the long run if it gets bad, it's replaceable. I do wonder the same about the headband material if it will get gross or stretched, but these first few weeks it's so comfortable I find reasons to reach for this headset over listening on other devices, just because I am liking it that much!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"sirkensington \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Pricey remote work headphones that work fantastic for calls\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"March 16, 2023\", \"content\": \"After seeing all the reviews and videos on the Air pods Max I decided to go with these instead of the Sony XM's because of the many reviews I saw of people feeling a lot of pressure on their head with ANC. I am very happy with my purchase because after the initial stretching of the headband, my air pods max are so comfy! The earcups are great for those who don't want to struggle with their hair getting stuck on the earcups as it just slide off! I have a small head and I feared that these would be too big/heavy for me but they are a great fit! For work I bought the Lightning to 3.5 mm Audio Cable for my work calls since my work laptop is not a Mac and it's great. I love using these in transparency mode as I can hear myself when I'm on work calls and also hear my surroundings when I am just listening to some music. They are VERY pricey but I see it as a great investment for remote work! I would opt to have these as just work headphones and MAYBE travel once in a while because of just how much space they take up with a third party case. (which I recommend buying because the one it comes with does not protect the mesh headband at all.) This isn't a NEED but if you are already considering spending the $400 for Sony or Bose headphones I would take a look at these in person before ruling them off. (Plus these go on sale sometimes so the difference between these and Sony/Bose goes from $150 to $80-$100.) If you want to be aware of your surroundings/hear your voice during calls, the transparency mode on Airpods Max is unmatched!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"MICHELLE \\u00b7 Review provided by nfm.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Amazing audio. Very comfortable.\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"November 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Will summarize a comparison between the Sony XM5\\u2019s towards the end of this review. The Airpods Max are very comfortable for long periods of time. The audio quality is great and crystal clear. It has good bass but not great. The noise canceling does a good job at atopping unwanted noises from interrupting your listening experience. All around, it is a beat of a product. You cannot go wrong with it. I own the XM5\\u2019s and comparing the two, the aipods max are more comfortable but the Sony XM5\\u2019s provide a deeper and louder bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s provide SLIGHTLY better noise canceling and should not be the overall deciding factor between the two. As far as sound quality, the airpods max takes the cake. You hear very crystal clear notes and voices with the airpods max and you can tell by listening that they are expensive headphones. The XM5 sound quality is great as well but the airpods max sound quality is just that much more better. Build wise, the airpods max are built to last because of its hard outer shell. The airpods max dont have that hard enclosure but thy do have a headband that is very flexible and will not break from any regular wear and tear. Coming from someone who unbiasly has both, i prefer the airpods max and only gave it a 4 star rating for its slight lack of bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s have great bass but arent really comfortable to wear, more specifically, outer ear pain. The ear cup of the sony XM5\\u2019s are not as deep or as large as the airpods max. So even if you have small ears, the xm5\\u2019s earcups can squish up against your ear slightyl but within 20 minutes, that pain and discomfort will be enough for you to want to take them off. Both are quality products and both are winners in their own right. However,i prefer apples airpods max.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"TechHead \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Great Noise Cancellation But Too HEFTY\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 1, 2023\", \"content\": \"Overall, I would recommend, but only if cost and weight are not deciding factors for you. TL;DR: Noise cancellation - Great! I had no idea my home and office were so loud until I tried these then took them off. Noise cancelling does have a few exceptions, like running water and other high frequency sounds like dish clanking. Sound - Quality is excellent, especially for streaming video. I used them wirelessly for conference calls; they can be wired as well with a lightning to aux cable. Weight - These are quite hefty compared to similar products, weighing in at around 40% heavier than the closest competitors. For me caused neck and upper back pain after only short periods of use (less than one hour). Design - I loved the mesh ear cups compared to other over ear products I've used. I found them comfortable, breathable, and safe for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. Price - These are immediately recognizable as an expensive item whereas competitor headphones are likely harder to recognize. This easy identification was a downside for me as I'd rather go with a set that is NOT such an obvious status symbol. Bottom Line: The hefty weight and hefty price...err, outweigh...the value for me. That said, if you are not concerned about the exorbitant cost or about putting your financial choices on display in such an obvious way, these are a great product for those embedded in the Apple ecosystem.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Niko \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Goodbye Beats\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"March 21, 2023\", \"content\": \"Its just a matter of team before Beats is fully phased out since no one buys them anymore. These AirPod Max have stolen the spotlight. They are very steep in price, but the build quality and sound that comes out of these, makes it worth it. Aside from the weight, the 9 microphones make these feel like you don't have them on - voices/outside sounds are that clear. If you wear glasses, these will hurt after a while from the pressure. After using these for a couple months (without glasses on), they don't hurt when I use them anymore. I guess I just have to position them a certain way where it doesn't make my head hurt. Do not workout in these since they are not water or sweat proof. If you do use them for the gym buy AppleCare so you can get a quick replacement if they stop working. The \\\"bra\\\" that the headphones come with is absolute junk. I'm surprised apple did not come up with a better solution. There are many sleep docks online that you can get for these and I do suggest you do that. Not only for ease of use but so you don't have use the original case and so you don't have to charge these every 1.5 days. With the sleep dock, I charge my headphone to 100% over the weekend, and by Friday, they are close to 10% left. The sad part is these are still hard to find unless you pay full price at the Apple Store.

I have watched multiple YouTube videos and have done several A/B tests between the AirPods Max and my old but rugged and road ready Pioneer HDJ-2000 headphones The Pioneers did their job at multiple gigs and clubs, but the AirPods Max blows them away for sound quality.

They worked great for a couple weeks and then mysteriously developed a connection issue. They will pair with the AppleTV but lose connection every time you shift them on your ears. You can't lift one or both sides off without losing connection. I tried turning off head tracking but it's still the same result. I have to manually restart them to reconnect. Also, I can't pair them to anything other than an Apple product. It doesn't go into pairing mode when I hold the noise cancellation button like it's supposed to. I'm also experiencing battery drain issues while they're in the case. All these issues coincided with the current 4E71 firmware release in May-2022. Now it's mid-July and no new firmware has been released. They are basically useless and have been collecting dust for over two months now while I wait on the new firmware that might fix it. Surely I'm not the only person with these issues. Apple needs to fix this. Other than that, the sound was about the same as my Beats Studio or JBL 660NC headphones.

The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to \\\"walking mode\\\"...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that \\\"commuting\\\" means \\\"non-stop fast travel from start to end\\\". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. - These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones. - It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen. - There's the option to use \\\"Spotify Tap\\\", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a \\\"feature\\\". - Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point. - No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point: These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"benkellis \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 24, 2022\", \"content\": \"If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/\\\"normal\\\" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities. The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and \\\"speak-to-chat,\\\" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mike \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Some stuff is good some stuff needs to be improved\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 3, 2022\", \"content\": \"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying. The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them. Will see.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Rafacast7 \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"As advertised but missing some big basic features\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"March 24, 2023\", \"content\": \"I found the reviews to be a bit too thorough as if they are paid advertisements that only echo online reviews by compensated individuals. The absence of any quick start guide was frustrating since I didn't have great cell coverage at the time I unboxed the headphones. I didn't know about the controls on the side and the app does not offer any guide either. I am still left in a maze to navigate their website in and out of hyperlinks to figure out which button or surface space does what. For an extremely high price these headphones are less about quality sound and more about noise canceling. If you like great audio, these aren't the headphones for you as they muffle and distort the sound. In general, noise canceling does that so that isn't a complete surprise. An astonishing and ridiculous issue I have with these headphones is that you CANNOT USE THEM WHILE THEY CHARGE?! In this era of device demand, this is a shockingly ignorant choice on the part of Sony. I get it, they might think since wireless earbuds can't be used while charging then who needs to listen to their headphones while they charge? Or perhaps they prioritized a fast charge over listening. The problem with that comes when you quick charge devices over and over again for short periods of time ruining the battery performance. Sony is practically begging you to do that by discouraging you from being able to listen to them at the same time as fully charging them. Overall I appreciate being able to drown out a good amount of background noise but I am left questioning if that's really worth the $400 price tag. If you are looking for noise canceling, pick a pair of great sounding earbuds and skip the actual noise canceling feature, just purchase some flight line ear protection headphones for a much better comfort and outside noise control. You'll save yourself hundreds while having a much lighter pair of headphones that doesn't overheat your ears. Another disappointment of mine was the erroneous idea that connecting to two devices at the same time would mean I could actually listen to two inputs at the same time. Perhaps Bluetooth isn't there yet through no fault of Sony, but I also felt the advertising was misleading on this particular feature and the answer was buried in Bluetooth spec and tech sites and not disclosed on the Sony site. I like that my phone can interrupt my business meeting playing from my computer but I dislike that I cannot listen to ambient sound on Pandora while participating in a business meeting at the same time. Since the audio can't be independently adjusted in noise volume by your individually connected device, you are left with a ring tone set to the same volume as your YouTube video or conversely the YouTube video resumes as loudly as the call and that is mildly annoying.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"AverageListener \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Great upgrade to an already great product\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"June 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products. Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling. The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good. I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal. I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great. There are other new features that you have to get used to: - the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful - similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane! Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it. Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time! Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up. In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GrenA \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"The BEST just got BETTER!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony has done it yet again; they\\u2019ve actually improved upon what I feel are the BEST noise cancelling wireless over-ear headphones available! The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions\\u2026and updated the look to a more modern design. What\\u2019s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case\\u2026which is a good size for traveling. They fit perfectly in the outside pocket of my backpack. The earphones were fully charged out of the box, so all that\\u2019s needed to get started (optional really, as they headphones will connect to your Bluetooth device anyway) is download the Sony Headphones Connect app and set up the earphones. There was a software update available for the headphones and it updated once they were connected. Fit and Function - The first thing I noticed was the new sleeker, more modern looking and lighter design of the XM5s. Although the design has changed, the comfort level is as plush and comfortable as ever. The ear cups and headband are super plush and easy to adjust to your head size. I've been wearing them almost non-stop for the last couple of days and there are no hotspots or uncomfortable rubbing. Hold the power button for a couple of seconds and then the magic starts, the noise canceling technology is fantastic, literally cutting out all the background noise as I mowed the lawn, went running or just listening to music while working around the house (my wife texts me as I can't hear her!). With the Auto Switching Based on Action, the noise cancelling level adjusts to your activity and the outside noise. Sound Quality - The sound quality is the BEST I've ever heard from Bluetooth NC headphones. Straight out of the box these things rock, but the Headphone Connect app gives the user the ability to set custom preferences for sound and services. From a noise canceling perspective Sony touts 8 total microphones and a newly designed 30mm driver to provide optimized noise canceling performance. So the 1000XM5s provide industry leading noise canceling and music that is so crisp and clear on the highs and the bass is rich and deep. Quality sound as expected from Sony! Headphone Connect App - it's a great tool for taking advantage of the many settings these headphones provide like Adaptive Sound Control, Noise Canceling Optimizer, Surround, Equalizer, Sound Quality Mode, Voice Assist, etc. Open the app, turn on the headphones and hold them close to connect and you\\u2019re ready to customize the earphones. The app is broken into four sections: Status, Sound. System and Services. Some of the functions are automatic like the Adaptive Sound Control - this will detect your surroundings and adjust the headphones accordingly. You can also select the Noise Canceling levels. The System tab is all about the operational settings like Auto Power Off, Touch Sensors, etc. Super easy to use and a great tool that\\u2019s very well laid out for the user. Cool (and totally useful) Functions - Not only do these headphones rock, they are loaded with super cool and totally useful Touch Features so you can adjust the music level, FF, Pause, answer phone calls, etc. by simply touching the right ear cup. And if that isn't enough, Sony has upped the game by adding Speak-To-Chat which stops the music and let\\u2019s in ambient sound so you can hold a conversation without having to take the earphones off or cover the right earphone (which still works) as the previous version supported. The other new function that really stands out to me is the Automatic Off (Wearing Detection) feature. By simply taking the headphones off, music is instantly paused until they are put back on\\u2026then the music instantly starts up again automatically. Not sure how Sony will add more features to these headphones in the future\\u2026but I\\u2019m sure they will do something amazing! Phone Calls \\u2013 Sound is great both on the speaker and headphone sides. No complaints from anyone I\\u2019ve talked to on the headphones. Your music will start right back up once the call is ended. Totally hands free and couldn\\u2019t be any easier to use! Battery Life - As mentioned, they came fully charged and after multiple days of use, they are still at 60%...this absolutely crushes the battery performance of my other NC headphones. And on top of that, there\\u2019s a quick charge feature that adds 3 hours of charge in just 3 minutes. Worrying about battery life is completely off the table based on my experience to date. Pros: - Noise Canceling and Sound Quality are second to none - Support for connecting to 2 different devices simultaneously - Ease of adjustability of sound and functions - Touch & Automatic Controls - control your music, pause or call without ever touching your phone - Fit and comfort is outstanding, even after hours of use \\u2013 no hot spots - Sony\\u2019s Headphone Connect App give the user complete control over setup and functionality of headphones - Taking Phone Calls - crisp and clear even in a crowded room - Recycled packaging is a nod to the environment by Sony Cons: - The new case is a bit larger than in the past, not a huge issue, but something that stood out The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are by far one of my new favorite devices and would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for the BEST noise canceling and function-packed over-the-ear headphones available.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mstanleynh \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"These might just be as good as it gets..........\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 30, 2022\", \"content\": \"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day. The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work. The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound. I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely. The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting! All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there? I'm not sure there is.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"occasionalstan \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Much improved sound quality and comfort\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony have excelled once again improving from the previous WH-1000XM4 headphones which I didn't think was possible. These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right earcup, I think sensitivity may have been improved as sliding my finger up and down or across the cup face worked first time every time. Taking phone calls also worked very well, could hear my caller no problem and same for the person calling hearing me clearly. The voice pickup to temporarily pause music playing when talking to someone is nice to have as well and didn't let me down, can be activated/de-activated in the Sony app, your choice. As for sound quality, they are superb and is probably somewhat dependant on quality of the music files played. If you can play Flac/Lossless files using LDAC audio then you will love them as Sony have clearly done work on improving all aspects of the sound stage. I have played Classical, Pop, Rock and Electronic music files and in my opinion the instrument separation from bass through middle to treble was much clearer, especially in the top range. Bass wasn't overbearing, but you can make it so from your sound source and it might overtake the mid to high notes, but everyone has their own preference, just saying you can boom the bass if you want it. All in all I think Sony have a winner once again. If I was to find one thing I didn't like so much, it's the case. I know its a different setup to the folding 1000XM4's case which I really like, albeit you can't fold that down flatter like the one provided with the 1000XM5. A minor niggle that doesn't detract from a great pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mel2955 \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what\\u2019s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony\\u2019s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Cessnatim \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"So far, so good.\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"These are an early Christmas present for me, the first over-ear wireless headphones I\\u2019ve had, chosen because of the reviews testifying to very good sound quality, good noise cancellation, comfort and battery staying power. I\\u2019ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside. Mostly I\\u2019ve listened to music but I\\u2019ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous. The human voice is a rich sound too, again with no apparent loss with even breathing audible on tracks where it was meant to be heard. Battery life seems very good. They arrived with about 60% charge and I recharged them when they got down to about 20% but that took about 10-14 days\\u2019 use of maybe 2 hours a day. No idea whether that\\u2019s good in comparison to others but certainly good enough for me. The set up was easy, noise cancellation is excellent from what I can make out, but I find the ability to pause this temporarily to head what someone is saying to me particularly helpful - just hold a hand over the right earpiece, ambient sound is restored very quickly and clearly, remove the hand and the music resumes. The headphones are comfy to wear, easy to adjust and while not tight, they seem to stay out so far when I\\u2019m bending down. The only very minor negative is that my ears get quite warm after I\\u2019ve worn them for about 1-2 hours, so I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d want them on for really extended periods. But that would be the same or worse for all headphones so no difference for these and I suspect other models might not be as comfortable. It\\u2019s true there are no free lunches and you get what you pay for, but with these I feel I\\u2019ve got good value for money. They come in a protective case which also contains the charging cable, and the app might be useful for connoisseurs wanting to tweak the set up but I\\u2019ve just used them with my music app on the phone. So, I\\u2019d say so far, so good.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Jeff Foot \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}]",

Packaging: Everything comes included in a small box, right away you can tell that the packaging was very well thought out and designed. Included in the box: Is a USB-A to USB-C cable, an upgrade to the older micro USB-B cable, so I liked that. Also inside the box you will find three different tips that are placed on the earbuds themselves, they come in small, medium and large, already installed are the medium sized ones, These fit the best for me. Also included are \\u201cbands\\u201d these bands wrap around the earbuds themselves. Basically what they do is they form a seal around your ear, These serve two purposes 1. they seal out outside noises out, and 2. They make the earbud fit perfect perfectly inside of your ear canal to protect against the ear buds falling out. Pairing: Connecting the earbuds to my smart phone was really easy, just press the button in the back of the charging case for a couple of seconds, pair them with your smart phone, and that\\u2019s it. Pretty standard and pretty easy. App: You\\u2019ll soon be prompted to download the Bose app. I Recommend everybody do this for couple of reasons, you can play around with the sound EQ settings, you can know exactly how much charge your earbuds have, you can program and swap different shortcuts, and the app can show you very well detailed tips on how to work your new earbuds, meaning it\\u2019ll show you how to pause your music, skip to the next song and raise or lower the volume by simply touching the side of the earbuds with your finger. Finally the thing I appreciate most about this app is that it doesn\\u2019t require you to create any kind of account if you don\\u2019t want to. Sound: The sound is as good as I have ever heard earbuds sound, clean, crisp, excellent highs, excellent mids, and the bass is good enough (these are not super bass heavy) there\\u2019s not much else to say really, these just sound great. Noice Cancelling: Perhaps the single greatest feature of these earbuds have is their sound canceling ability. When in \\u201cQuiet\\u201d mode, The earbuds block out sound better than any earbuds I have ever tried before, then there\\u2019s \\u201cAware\\u201d turn this on if you still want to listen to your music but still be able to hear outside noises (like if you are out in the street and still want to hear cars coming) I think what happens here is the microphone gets turned on and you\\u2019re then able to then hear the outside noises this way, kind of like a hearing aid. Both Quiet mode and Aware mode work very well. Conclusion: I recommend Bose\\u2019s newest earphones to anybody that is reading my review and interested in this product, you will be happy with your purchase. I highly recommend downloading the app and downloading the newest software update for them for the best experience. + Sound + Design + Features +App +The Bands +Comfortable +Battery life -Charging case is made of plastic and feels somewhat cheap\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ernesto \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Outstanding BOSE sound quailty\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 6, 2022\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019ve used a few earbuds in the past, always different brands and were never totally satisfied with the sound quality, \\u201cespecially me with some hearing issues\\u201d. Bose has come out with a new model of the Quietcomfort earbuds, the \\u201cII\\u201d model was just released, and we decided to give them a try. Unboxing and setup: The earbuds come in a very small Bose logoed box, and inside there\\u2019s a charger case, \\u201cwith the earbuds nestled inside\\u201d, a USB C charging cable, sm/lg eartips, sm/lg stability bands \\u201cthe medium was already on the buds\\u201d, a quick start guide and a small but surprisingly thick manual in multiple languages. The first thing I did was to plug in the charging cable \\u201chave plenty of USB C ones already so didn\\u2019t bother with the OEM one, let them charge up and proceeded to start syncing. We also installed the Bose Music Android App before proceeding. Synching on our Samsung phones was simple, just open the lid to the charger, press the button on the back of the case/charger so the blue light blinks on the front then search/pair on your phone. Once we did that and the Bose app found them it immediately showed there was an update, so we let that proceed \\u201cwhich does take a few minutes so just be patient\\u201d. After the earbuds were paired it was time to try them out. Now these buds are a little larger than the Samsung ones we have \\u201cnot by much\\u201d and they do stick down a little more than them too, but once you find your fit they are just as comfortable \\u201cmaybe a little bit better IMO\\u201d, they didn\\u2019t feel like they were going to fall out easily and the app has a test you can run to be sure they are seated correctly. I do like to that they don\\u2019t actually turn on till one of them \\u201cright for us\\u201d is inserted and then you\\u2019ll hear the voice prompt confirming and battery charge. Use: We were both totally blown away by the sound quality, there\\u2019s even plenty of bass for us, and having any bass in a earbud is a pretty tough feat. Naturally it\\u2019s not chest pounding bass but it\\u2019s more than enough to give the feeling of nice deep bass, and that\\u2019s adjustable in the EQ of the App. We also like that you can adjust the noise cancellation can be adjusted from 0 \\u201cnone\\u201d to 100 \\u201cmax cancellation\\u201d, with it turned up to 100 I couldn\\u2019t make out what my wife was saying standing right in front of me, the same with her when she was wearing them, which was a little odd but easily adjusted so you can at least make out some background noise. These would be perfect in a very noisy environment as long as you don\\u2019t need to hear what\\u2019s going on around you. There are also multiple presets \\u201cmodes\\u201d that you can pick from and even customize your own. There\\u2019s also a setting in the noise cancellation that uses what BOSE calls \\u201cActive Sense\\u201d, it\\u2019s under the \\u201cAware\\u201d mode, and it will adjust the cancellation for loud noises so it will protect your hearing from very loud noises. It actually worked pretty well when I ran the vacuum cleaner, I could tell the sound was muffled but as soon as I turned it off I could hear the background noises again, \\u201cpretty neat\\u201d. I went outside and did some light yard work and only once did one of the buds come out a little, and that caused the sound to pause, so you know it\\u2019s not inserted correctly, an easy slight twist put it right back in. I contributed that to sweat running around my ears as it was 108F out and after a few minutes out in that anyone is going to be sweating. I\\u2019ve never had earbuds fit as well as these, most of the time I would just quit using them halfway through a project as they kept popping out due to sweat. As for call quality, neither of us had issues hearing calls, everyone said they heard us clearly and even with my hearing issues I could easily make out what everyone was saying. I will say I wish the equalizer could be adjusted for each earbud individually. My right ear is my troublemaker, and it would be nice to be able to adjust the equalizer separately so I could fine tune them. These actually sound much better than my Siemens hearing aids, and they don\\u2019t cost nearly as much. Listening to music is no compairson with them, and I usually use a full headphone to get full sound with the Bose I can get the same effect. The controls are easy to use, the outside of the main piece that sticks out \\u201csort of a oblong pill shape\\u201d , is the touch sensitive control. You can swipe up/down for volume, tap twice to advance track, three taps reverses and one tap pauses, pretty simple. You can answer calls with a single tap, and The only issue I had there is the touch area is very sensitive and it\\u2019s very easy to bump when you reach up to adjust the buds or try a function. Grabbing them gently by the sides and not bumping the touch sensitive area can be a little difficult at times but I\\u2019m sure it just takes some practice, but you have to be careful till you get used to them. Conclusion: We\\u2019ve never owned earbuds that actually sound as good as these, and the noise cancellation is simply amazing. I find myself wearing these most of the day as they are comfortable enough to forget you are wearing them, \\u201cI just have to remember not to have the noise cancellation up too high or I\\u2019ll never hear my wife calling for me, vice versa too\\u201d. If you are looking for a premium set of earbuds, and yes they do cost more than others but you are getting BOSE sound quality that goes with that. I won\\u2019t be using any of my other buds as they will just not stand up to these in any way that I can see, and for me, the sound quality is just unmatched.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SteveC \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Very good, although not quite perfect\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 8, 2022\", \"content\": \"Having used a variety of over-ear headphones and earbuds of varying budgets (\\u00a3\\u00a3 to \\u00a3\\u00a3\\u00a3), wired and wireless, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the Bose QC II Earbuds. Took me a while to get them fitting how I liked, especially as the fitment was different to the usual wired earbuds I've used for years, with the ear canal piece being more rectangular than circular. Eventually got them sitting right and the fitment does actually feel better than what I've been used to. Saying that, I often get this little nagging feeling that the left earpiece is going to come loose, and yet it's very much firmly in place if I try to move it about. Tried various combinations of the different sized accessories with no real improvement, but it's a minor quibble, especially as I've used these for home workouts successfully; they've certainly never come close to falling out or anything like that. Noise-cancelling is decent. A lot is made of how class-leading these are in that respect, and I certainly don't think they're anything less than very good in that department, but in terms of blocking out outside noise when there's no audio playing, I don't think they're a clear step-up over what I've been used to. Audio quality is good; definitely an improvement over my various pairs of earbuds I've had, although no better than a pair of popular wireless headphones I have, but then those have much larger drivers, so perhaps an unfair comparison. Only mentioning because I saw someone mention elsewhere that they replaced their OE headphones with a pair of earbuds, and I don't think I'd be doing that myself; these QC IIs are very much for situations where bigger headphones aren't really suitable, such as going outside or exercising/running etc. Bluetooth connection/App seems stable, not had any connectivity issues so far. Actually went into the garage and forgot to take my phone with me, but the signal was still fairly stable, even though I was quite some distance from the source and had several doors/buildings blocking the signal potentially, so I'd have no concerns about dropouts in normal usage, impressive in that regard. Touch controls are simple and effective, although the pause/resume function does \\\"feel\\\" a bit laggy, but that may well be to do with ensuring pausing/resuming gestures aren't mixed up with the next/previous track function. Not a big deal as audio stops promptly if you tap the earbuds, I just have to remind myself to give them a few seconds to resume when I tap them again. I do wish there was a little audio beep or something when adjusting the volume as there is with my headphones. Although speaking of volume, these do need to be at a higher volume level than what I'm used to with other headphones/earbuds that I wear. Overall, a good buy.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"SPZ02 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Excellent Bass, Good Noise Cancelling for Ear Buds\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 21, 2022\", \"content\": \"I have always wanted to try Bose headphones knowing them to be a premium brand and having read many reviews. I have gone through a number of ear buds from a range of companies some premium and some more mainstream and always found the sound quality lacking in earbuds style as opposed to over ear designs. When I received my earbuds they were well packaged as you would expect the card case separates to reveal the various components of buds, case, cable and varying size buds and surround seals to ensure a good fit within the ear. As always frustratingly having opened the box everything needs charging so no fun for the first night! Within the pack is the QR code to download the Bose software for both IOA and android devices. Once charged and with software installed the setup was incredibly easy, it found the buds without having to go to settings find devices add pairing codes etc they just connected and then the software guided through the fitting phase to ensure the correct buds and surrounds were fitted. The sound test suggested everything was good to go. WOW was my first impression of sound quality, these little buds really had some good bass, within the app there is an equaliser which lets you change the base mid and treble and I am the sort of person that loves more Bass and Treble. these earbuds did not disappoint in sound quality for sure. Next came the programming of tap which in comparison to other models is more limited as there is basically a choice of which ear for the two settings, double taps, long taps etc are not catered for in this part of the app. The next test was for noise counselling which I have only ever found work fully on over the ear designs at premium prices. The noise cancellation in a normal environment is actually really good for these, it does not cancel everything but it certainly makes a difference and more so than other buds I have had in the past from premium brands. The only fault I have found is when cycling or running in wind conditions this is replicated as white noise slightly while listening to music. I think the only thing I have been disappointed with is the inability to charge the case wirelessly unless I have an incompatible charger this is not a feature of these earbuds as there was no evidence of charging no matter how I laid down the case and this is something I assumed would be the case. Overall these are the best earbuds I have owned so far, they compare with other brands but will still not beat over the ear!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GEG87 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Another flagship wireless earbuds from Bose\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 28, 2022\", \"content\": \"Designing appearances: First of all, the improvement of the charging box is particularly obvious. The charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II returns from the jewelry box style of the previous generation to the design direction of the mainstream TWS earphone charging box, resulting in a smaller size. What's more interesting is that the battery life of the charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II has been upgraded in spite of the reduced size! Wearing experience: The earplugs have undergone substantial alterations. Bose QC Earbuds II divided the previous generation of fish fin earplugs into two sections, the eartips and the stability bands, and called it \\\"Fit Kit ear kit\\\" The meaning of the Fit Kit is to solve the problem of ear fit for different users. You may encounter a certain type of noise-canceling earphones that are recognized as excellent in noise-canceling, but it feels average when it comes to you. The reason for this is probably that the earphones are not well adapted to your ear shape. After all, everyone's ear shape is different, and many people even have differences between their left and right ears. Noise-cancelling capability: Everyone who is familiar with the working principle of noise-cancelling headphones knows that the headphones will analyze and collect sound waves from the external environment, and create a reverse sound wave in the ear to cancel. The current flagship noise-cancelling headphones on the market perform very well in this regard. The Bose QC Earbuds II went a step further on this basis, focusing on the part of the ear, and made a smart in-ear sound field adjustment technology. When you insert the earbuds, you will hear a tone, which means that the smart in-ear sound field adjustment is working. At this time, it will automatically analyze the structure of the wearing ear canal, and then optimize the noise cancellation effect and sound quality of the earphones, thereby realizing \\\"volume customization\\\". Sound quality: The official description, the sound concept of Bose QC Earbuds II is balanced. After actual listening, I personally think it is true. The first impressions are incredibly supple and enduring. Each of the three frequency bands is fairly orderly, and nobody is trying to steal the show. Summarize: If you are looking for noise reduction and wearing comfort, Bose QC Earbuds II will not disappoint you!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"JC \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"A music producers opinion\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 15, 2023\", \"content\": \"After ditching my old amazon bought earbuds and wearing over the had headphones for the better part of a year or so, I finally decided to get myself new earbuds. After about a month of research into what's on offer today I decided to use the 90-day risk free trial that is offered directly from Bose and go for the QC2, which are easily one of the most expensive earbuds you can buy, so do you get what you pay for? Yes. But here is my breakdown of all the features, from someone who has been producing and making music in studios for over a decade, I know a little thing or two about sound. So here goes. The Fit: Having the option between 3 different ear tip buds and 3 different wing bands leaves you with a good amount of choice in finding the fit that works for you, initially I found a good fit and the earbuds stay pretty firm in my ears for the most part. They have yet to actually fall out but I do find myself adjusting the left earbud quite frequently, as I get the feeling that it's going to fall out. This is quite annoying but manageable, and will be different for each user. I'm confident you'll find a good enough fit. The earbuds are comfortable for long periods of time and I have worn them for working out and they do stay put, but again, I find myself adjusting them a bit. Overall 4/5. The sound: I was expecting great things from the sound but overall, it is okay. It certainly isn't the best I've experienced, but certainly not the worst. The tuning is very well balanced I think, and there's no unusual emphasis on the Bass which is what a lot of companies tend to do so you get a fairly equal sound. I do sometimes find the high ends to be a bit harsh, particularly when listening to distorted guitar solos (Metallica, Megadeth etc) but this isn't too often. I do wish the sound would go louder though, My old earbuds would go very loud before hitting that phone sound warning that said you are in hearing loss territories but the QC2 don't go very loud before hitting that threshold, I find myself on the highest setting before the mark which is annoying because sometimes you want that loudness. This is probably my biggest gripe in terms of the sound, as a musician I appreciate the overall balance that these earbuds provide, but again, for the absolute best sound experience there are probably better earbuds out there. Overall 4/5 The noise cancelling and aware mode: Easily the best noise cancelling I've personally ever experienced. The quiet mode setting, truly gets rid of the outside world, it is remarkable. I can walk down the street with the setting enabled, with cars roaring passed me and I barely notice they are there, I'm focused on the sound on my ears which is an absolute blessing. The aware mode, which simulates Apples transparency mode is okay, I find there to be quite a bit of unnatural white noise which can become a bit tiresome after a while but overall it does a decent job. It also has an automatic feature which dampens loud sound around you (for example a door slamming) which is quite cool, but feels a bit weird. The noise cancelling though? Excellent. Overall 5/5 The app: I'm really not the biggest fan of the app. It's plain, boring, uninspired and you really don't get a lot from it. There's some tips and 'tricks' on there that really just tell you how to get the best fit for your ears etc. It let's you set two more custom noise settings (letting you adjust the level of noise cancelling and aware mode levels.) There's an EQ which lets you adjust the Bass, Mids, and Highs on the earbuds but you only get 3 bands which compared to other sound apps (JBL for instance) is quite terrible. If you want to adjust the sound I would recommend using a separate app with more customising options. Most of the time I find the earbuds cannot connect to the app anyway and without the connection, you are unable to do anything on the app, rendering it completely useless. Overall once you've had a look at the app, set your EQ preferences and set your noise modes, you won't be using it much and it's quite forgettable. Overall I'd give these earbuds a 4/5. With a good fit, good sound, great noise cancelling and and okay app these earbuds are certainly up there in terms of what you can buy. I do however think they are overpriced. I personally just do not think they are that good to be charging one of the highest prices on the market for earbuds, if you can get these discounted then certainly go for it but at full price, I do think there are probably pretty good cheaper alternatives. If you're main buying point is noise cancelling though, you probably want to take the plunge on these though. Do I regret buying them? No, they are good. But think carefully about how much you are willing to spend.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"DJN \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Best noise cancelling\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 9, 2022\", \"content\": \"These are the best noise cancelling earbuds, I have owned Jabra, Samsung, and Sony earbuds also. These have such good noise cancelling that my wife came behind me while I was doing dishes talking to my and said I could hear her and was just pretending I couldn't hear her, but I really couldn't hear her..... Now for the negative, my wife owns a dog training business and there are a lot of dogs that bark, it does a good job blocking out the barking except the very high pitches which you hear a popping sound, which I heard from interference with certain manufacturer machines that have a high pitch sound also. I do dislike how the left earbud is slave to the right earbud, which means you can't use the earbuds independently, with the right earbud being the master bud. But hopefully they will fix this with a futures update. But what I do LOVE and these earbuds is that I can pause, play, volume up/down, move track forward/backwards, and move between the different ANC seeing simultaneously with the right earbud. This is a phenomenal feature that I believe these are the only earbuds that have. They have definitely improved the Bass in this version and have superior sounds (Sony XM4's still have the best drivers but not much of a difference between these and Don't). Case size is normal for this price range, the obly 2 downsizes is no wireless charging (which I normally never use) and that the earbuds are not magnetic, sometimes they don't get a good connection to charge, but doesn't happen too often). People do complain about the eartip design, which does take a little to get use to, but after having it for a couple weeks, it does help with the ANC. As far as it's shape, I LOVE it. The XM4's, Samsung, and Jabras I would accidently be pressing the buttons taking the earbuds in and out, with these I can mess with them without worrying, which is a stress relieve. Battery life, they are not as good as Jabras, which have the best battery life I have tried yet, but after Jabra, they are are average for the price range. They ANC does drain the battery but as much as other brands, but worth it for how good the ANC is. Price range, the price is about right for what you are getting. Final words, they are the best wireless earbuds I have owned out of multiple brands for what I need. If you want best sound quality, go with the Sony XM4'S the 2022 version, not the /B version (which is having battery drain issues right now due to firmware update). If you want top of the line earbuds in budget I would go with either Jabra or Samsung, which both are GREAT earbuds. But the BOSE have THE BEST ANC, have all controls on the right earbud, great sound quality, and come from a good company. Do they have everything I want? NO, but I won't find an earbud that does. Do I sometimes question these earbuds, yes. Would I buy these again, in a heartbeat. So if you want an overall top of the line for earbuds, these are great! The only reason that I don't give them 5 stars is due to the periodically popping sound, which other earbuds have also (Sony, Dr. Dre) but should be able to be fixed in a software update, which when that happens I will give 5 stars and I am a rough at rating, my wife can tell you that.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"techsavy \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Don't buy Bose at any cost!\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"January 7, 2023\", \"content\": \"I originally bought the Quiet Comfort earbuds in January 2022 which needed replacing and repair about 4 times in a few months (which obviously took up A LOT of time with the admin of talking to JL and going into store etc), until the last time they got sent away where I was told there'd be a week turn around to receive another new pair. Fast forward 6 weeks and they're still 'in progress'. Had to speak to JL (and Bose) directly to find out they had no stock to send my replacement. I was about to give up and get a refund when I suggested I'd try the upgraded pair if JL would offer me that free of charge, which they kindly did (\\u00a330 difference). I received the QC II and had similar problems, left bud always draining of charge or not fully charging, the sound warping between both earbuds, the microphone picking up too much background noise so phone calls outside meant the recipient was not able to hear me, as well as trouble connecting to my phone on every start up, taking about 5-10 mins, putting them back in their case, restarting Bluetooth, opening and closing the app etc. Very inconvenient on the go. Alongside all these defects, the design was off for me. In order to scroll through various noise cancelling levels you can't just hold your finger on the earbud (which also, by the way, didn't fit in my ear properly so fell out multiple times, so-much-so I avoided wearing them when moving a lot), you have to press for ~2 seconds then release for ~2 seconds then press again etc to go through your various modes, which I felt was generally impractical and annoying, especially as it didn't respond to heavy touch but equally didn't with too light a touch. It also meant the right one was even more likely to fall out of my ear. It also made me look like a wannabe Spy. The noise cancelling also broke on the first few pairs I had, and a high pitched whining noise existed when not listening to music. To operate the volume control it requires a swipe, but it never seem to respond properly and would often pause my music or end the call I was on (which is actually the double tap function). All in all, it was a terrible purchase I wish I'd never made, but it was made slightly simpler by the fact the in-store John Lewis Tech team in Bristol made the return easy for me and were very helpful. I am now sworn off Bose for good (I also have a portable speaker which has connective and sound quality issues) but the silver lining is that I would purchase from JL again, knowing that my purchase was protected.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Kitty \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"amazing sound quality. lacks some features\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"October 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I rate these headphones a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the sound quality but I have a few things I'm disappointed in especially because of the price point. i really wish the bose name wasn't so large on the side of the earbud it's so distracting wish it was maybe smaller or on an edge. it has no wireless charging BUT that means it weighs less not an issue for me. there is no indication on the case that says anything about the battery and its a bigger case than other types of wireless earbuds but significantly smaller than past bose cases so that's good. there isnt a button that allows you to open the case which means that the case opens too easily also from my experience. the magnets don't really help the case stay closed. the process to pair it is a little difficult. first of all you have to have the app which i don't like and a lot of other wireless headphone don't need an app but if you want to customized your sound quality these are a great option.i like the ear buds that just pair with the phone by Bluetooth but this is definitely very technical The best part about these headphones is that they do live up to the Bose name in terms of noise canceling. It feels like it adjusts to the sound intensity. The quality of calling people is good also because it's very clear. I do agree that the charging time for the earbuds lasts about 6 hours with no issues. Again, you can customize the sound quality on the app. As most earbuds, these come with 3 different soft silicone ear tips and 3 stability bands but for the price I do think there need to be even more tip options for a good fit for everyone These look big in my ears but I was suprised they aren't heavy. I do wish that again for the price point that they would come with the option of over the ear holders too. It seems big but they do have a lot of features especially the swiping on the outside of the earbud wide portion that's unique and there's enough room for your finger to slide easily and a groove to know when to stop You do need to use certain functions on certain earbud and not that can be done on either one. The quiet and aware modes are unique and I'm glad there two options, you may need to play around to get used to them. I personally like the aware mode as it allows for more background noise to get in and I can still pay attention to other things, but there is an area you can change the noise cancelation and tailor it. I think you can only use the voice feature on the right earbud. you can't use one earbud independent of another at the moment uless you leave both outside the case but i did read it may become Available in an update. you also have to be careful with the amplifying power of these earbuds because some sounds are so loud in your ear. personally i do not walk around with earbuds i only use them to work out but would definitely not wear these all the time if I was looking for that option without removingsome of the noise canceling because its so intense almost like wearing earplugs. PLEASE add a find my earbud feature to the app it's really needed!

You know it's working as each bud plays a short note before announcing the device it's paired with, and that announcement goes from being a tad muffled to crystal-clear in the space of a second or less, as the NC is adjusted. Sound Quality The Bose buds have a beefy sound that's underpinned with solid bass, not muddy in any way. The top end can be shrill but is easily moderated with the in-app equalizer. The noise cancellation really helps by removing all distractions and allowing you to focus on the music, it might not be audiophile quality but it is very satisfying. Noise Cancelling Just amazing. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 which were, until now, pretty much unbeatable. The Boses handily trump them. There is some hiss if you have them NC on with no music, in a quiet room, but in any other scenario they are a miracle made flesh, they simply erase what's going on around you better than any other headphone I've heard. The 'aware' mode is great too, people talk about the Apple Airpods Pro as having the best but these are in the same division, passed through noise sounds very natural and that mode doesn't make the music sound tinnier as some others I've heard do. Battery life Good, or rather, normal. 6 hours-ish plus 2 more charges from the case with NC on all the time. Fit and comfort Good, if unusual. There is a pack containing 3 sets of rings and 3 sets of ear tips, the rings help to hold the buds in place and form a seal, the tips do what tips normally do and you can get a perfect fit by mixing and matching them. The app has a sound test you can run to check if you have the best fit, which works perfectly. In my case the defaults were just fine. Once setup, they don't wobble or feel in any way loose Conclusion Amazing.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"ElleCee \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}]",

The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect. The AirPods Max are clearly designed to emulate the experience of AirPods, they don't have a powerbutton and are meant to be put back in the case after use, and then when removed from case are already connected to your device. They work well in that sense. Where it doesn't make sense though is that the 'smart' case you get is odd, it's not protective but it's also not small enough to pocket, so you end up buying a third party hard case for travelling and then for taking the headphones to work etc you don't take the smart case. The only positive is that the headphones left outside the case still go into their lower power states, but it's just slower to do so than it is in the case. Still, this is a very strange solution for a problem that would have been solved by just having a physical off button, as it is they drain a small amount of battery even if in the case. It feels like Apple being stubborn about maintaining the characteristics of 'AirPods' despite the over ear headphone category having different expectations. I have had issues with them being left a couple of days in the case and getting 'stuck' off and needing to be plugged in to 'revive' them, bizarre, and again, would have been solved with a physical power button. Overall however I like the sound quality and the fit and finish but think they only make sense for users who are 100% inside Apple's ecosystem.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"\\u00b7 Review provided by digitec.ch\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Great headphones!

If you are looking for clear and balanced sound, these fit the bill. They feel solid in your hands (and heavy on the head) but comfortable to wear (at least for me) for a few hours. Noise cancellation is better than my Sony XM4. Digital crown dial and secondary button does the trick to play, pause, and toggle ANC (Sony did spoil me with the tapping of headset to play/pause but it's fine) Spatial audio is mind blowing and the convenience to easily connect to any Apple device - including the Apple TV is how you're rewarded for being a part of their ecosystem. Sony's way to pair only two devices simultaneously comes at a cost of lower bitrate of music. And if paired with an iPhone, when people call me, they tell me I sound great with little background noise. It is a bit of a head scratcher that they don't support the higher quality bitrate of music that Apple Music has in their library. Also, charging by lightning cable instead of USB-C is also a selfish decision on their part but the battery life is great. If you have a really large head, make a hard pass onto something else. If you want skull crushing bass response, go elsewhere. The bra/purse/case to allow it to go into very low power mode is not very attractive in my opinion. Thankfully there are 3rd party cases that now do the same thing and it protects it better when thrown in the backpack for travel. I got these headphone at a great price due to price matching (Amazon), BB rewards cash back, and a gift certificate I got for my b-day. Took the price way down below $300 (and it came included with 2 years of AppleCare).

I got these because they were on sale and my old pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I loved) were failing, so I figured I would buy these and worst case exchange for Sony headphones if these weren't worth the premium. I watched a lot of reviews, MKBHD had a review and I thought it seemed oversold on sound quality compared to what I thought was really good with the Sony options always, and I was initially underwhelmed and worried I would end up exchanging. Then I let them sit for a bit and settled in and used them for a day or two for my calls/video conferencing and music. I started to realize how much clarity I got without really losing anything. Instead of getting that punchy bass everywhere, you get bass that really acts as emphasis. Vocals are crystal clear. Mic quality is excellent. Comfort wise it is great over long periods. Noise canceling is at least as good (honestly seems better) than other headests I've had. Ambient mode is way better and doesn't have that harsh sound. Only knock on it is if you're doing anything active with them on I feel like the mesh cups do tend to absorb a bit more. The plastic backing makes it a little hard to clean but not impossible. They DO sell replacement ones, so I guess in the long run if it gets bad, it's replaceable.

The Airpods Max are very comfortable for long periods of time. The audio quality is great and crystal clear. It has good bass but not great. The noise canceling does a good job at atopping unwanted noises from interrupting your listening experience. All around, it is a beat of a product. You cannot go wrong with it. I own the XM5\\u2019s and comparing the two, the aipods max are more comfortable but the Sony XM5\\u2019s provide a deeper and louder bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s provide SLIGHTLY better noise canceling and should not be the overall deciding factor between the two. As far as sound quality, the airpods max takes the cake. You hear very crystal clear notes and voices with the airpods max and you can tell by listening that they are expensive headphones. The XM5 sound quality is great as well but the airpods max sound quality is just that much more better. Build wise, the airpods max are built to last because of its hard outer shell. The airpods max dont have that hard enclosure but thy do have a headband that is very flexible and will not break from any regular wear and tear. Coming from someone who unbiasly has both, i prefer the airpods max and only gave it a 4 star rating for its slight lack of bass. The sony XM5\\u2019s have great bass but arent really comfortable to wear, more specifically, outer ear pain. The ear cup of the sony XM5\\u2019s are not as deep or as large as the airpods max. So even if you have small ears, the xm5\\u2019s earcups can squish up against your ear slightyl but within 20 minutes, that pain and discomfort will be enough for you to want to take them off. Both are quality products and both are winners in their own right. However,i prefer apples airpods max.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"TechHead \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Great Noise Cancellation But Too HEFTY\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 1, 2023\", \"content\": \"Overall, I would recommend, but only if cost and weight are not deciding factors for you. TL;DR: Noise cancellation - Great! I had no idea my home and office were so loud until I tried these then took them off. Noise cancelling does have a few exceptions, like running water and other high frequency sounds like dish clanking. Sound - Quality is excellent, especially for streaming video. I used them wirelessly for conference calls; they can be wired as well with a lightning to aux cable. Weight - These are quite hefty compared to similar products, weighing in at around 40% heavier than the closest competitors. For me caused neck and upper back pain after only short periods of use (less than one hour). Design - I loved the mesh ear cups compared to other over ear products I've used. I found them comfortable, breathable, and safe for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. Price - These are immediately recognizable as an expensive item whereas competitor headphones are likely harder to recognize. This easy identification was a downside for me as I'd rather go with a set that is NOT such an obvious status symbol. Bottom Line: The hefty weight and hefty price...err, outweigh...the value for me. That said, if you are not concerned about the exorbitant cost or about putting your financial choices on display in such an obvious way, these are a great product for those embedded in the Apple ecosystem.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Niko \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Goodbye Beats\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"March 21, 2023\", \"content\": \"Its just a matter of team before Beats is fully phased out since no one buys them anymore. These AirPod Max have stolen the spotlight. They are very steep in price, but the build quality and sound that comes out of these, makes it worth it. Aside from the weight, the 9 microphones make these feel like you don't have them on - voices/outside sounds are that clear. If you wear glasses, these will hurt after a while from the pressure. After using these for a couple months (without glasses on), they don't hurt when I use them anymore. I guess I just have to position them a certain way where it doesn't make my head hurt. Do not workout in these since they are not water or sweat proof. If you do use them for the gym buy AppleCare so you can get a quick replacement if they stop working. The \\\"bra\\\" that the headphones come with is absolute junk. I'm surprised apple did not come up with a better solution. There are many sleep docks online that you can get for these and I do suggest you do that. Not only for ease of use but so you don't have use the original case and so you don't have to charge these every 1.5 days. With the sleep dock, I charge my headphone to 100% over the weekend, and by Friday, they are close to 10% left. The sad part is these are still hard to find unless you pay full price at the Apple Store. I definitely recommend these headphones especially if they are at a discount.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"RoyP \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11415085711667766387/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:18309688519637937883_0,pid:13998887421003899116,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqtyf2pf-AhW7D1kFHc8zBAUQqSQIfg\", \"title\": \"Holy crap these are good\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 22, 2022\", \"content\": \"I don\\u2019t consider myself an audiophile\\u2014I just consider myself someone who can fairly differentiate between good and bad sound and how to identify compression artifacts in audio.

I\\u2019m the type of person who immediately judges the sound systems at clubs, bars, etc. I have a pair of AirPods Pros mainly for utilitarian purposes (doing CEUs, Zoom calls, etc.) and found that I ALWAYS had to make adjustments to get some decent bass out of them. After all the hype and seeing these on sale, I picked up a pair of AirPods Max for $430 brand new with my Best Buy rewards. I have watched multiple YouTube videos and have done several A/B tests between the AirPods Max and my old but rugged and road ready Pioneer HDJ-2000 headphones The Pioneers did their job at multiple gigs and clubs, but the AirPods Max blows them away for sound quality. The low end you hear in movies is something you have to hear to believe. The soundstage that so many talk about is the best I have ever heard in a set of headphones. All that computational audio\\u2014akin to the computations Apple implements in iPhones to create great photos from very small camera sensors\\u2014just about makes bluetooth sound as best as it can.

I bought these to use with my AppleTV after the wife and kid went to sleep at night so I can watch my shows without keeping them awake. They worked great for a couple weeks and then mysteriously developed a connection issue. They will pair with the AppleTV but lose connection every time you shift them on your ears. You can't lift one or both sides off without losing connection. I tried turning off head tracking but it's still the same result. I have to manually restart them to reconnect. Also, I can't pair them to anything other than an Apple product. It doesn't go into pairing mode when I hold the noise cancellation button like it's supposed to. I'm also experiencing battery drain issues while they're in the case. All these issues coincided with the current 4E71 firmware release in May-2022. Now it's mid-July and no new firmware has been released. They are basically useless and have been collecting dust for over two months now while I wait on the new firmware that might fix it. Surely I'm not the only person with these issues. Apple needs to fix this. Other than that, the sound was about the same as my Beats Studio or JBL 660NC headphones. They do have good noise cancellation.

They have a good weight to them, they\\u2019re sleek, and most importantly they are very comfortable! I can wear them for hours, unlike my airpod pros that would either fall out constantly or make my ears sore after only an hour or two. Love that you can replace the ear pads too, as I wear makeup a lot and plan on getting a second pair of ear pads for the times I\\u2019m not wearing makeup and/or sweating. I also pop them off and let them air out after wearing them for an extended time as condensation builds up a little inside under the mesh. They hold a charge pretty well too. I wear them daily for several hours and have only charged them twice. I did buy little clear Spigen covers/cases for the ear can (I think that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re called) to protect them from getting scratched or worn as they do tend to clink together when getting them out of the case.

\"title\": \"Better design, with worse...well, everything else\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"October 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"I bought this 3 months ago, excited to upgrade from my previous Sony headphones. The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to \\\"walking mode\\\"...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that \\\"commuting\\\" means \\\"non-stop fast travel from start to end\\\". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. - These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones. - It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen. - There's the option to use \\\"Spotify Tap\\\", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a \\\"feature\\\". - Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point. - No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point: These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"benkellis \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 24, 2022\", \"content\": \"If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/\\\"normal\\\" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities. The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and \\\"speak-to-chat,\\\" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mike \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Some stuff is good some stuff needs to be improved\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 3, 2022\", \"content\": \"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying. The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them.

The absence of any quick start guide was frustrating since I didn't have great cell coverage at the time I unboxed the headphones. I didn't know about the controls on the side and the app does not offer any guide either. I am still left in a maze to navigate their website in and out of hyperlinks to figure out which button or surface space does what. For an extremely high price these headphones are less about quality sound and more about noise canceling. If you like great audio, these aren't the headphones for you as they muffle and distort the sound. In general, noise canceling does that so that isn't a complete surprise. An astonishing and ridiculous issue I have with these headphones is that you CANNOT USE THEM WHILE THEY CHARGE?! In this era of device demand, this is a shockingly ignorant choice on the part of Sony. I get it, they might think since wireless earbuds can't be used while charging then who needs to listen to their headphones while they charge? Or perhaps they prioritized a fast charge over listening. The problem with that comes when you quick charge devices over and over again for short periods of time ruining the battery performance. Sony is practically begging you to do that by discouraging you from being able to listen to them at the same time as fully charging them. Overall I appreciate being able to drown out a good amount of background noise but I am left questioning if that's really worth the $400 price tag. If you are looking for noise canceling, pick a pair of great sounding earbuds and skip the actual noise canceling feature, just purchase some flight line ear protection headphones for a much better comfort and outside noise control. You'll save yourself hundreds while having a much lighter pair of headphones that doesn't overheat your ears. Another disappointment of mine was the erroneous idea that connecting to two devices at the same time would mean I could actually listen to two inputs at the same time. Perhaps Bluetooth isn't there yet through no fault of Sony, but I also felt the advertising was misleading on this particular feature and the answer was buried in Bluetooth spec and tech sites and not disclosed on the Sony site. I like that my phone can interrupt my business meeting playing from my computer but I dislike that I cannot listen to ambient sound on Pandora while participating in a business meeting at the same time. Since the audio can't be independently adjusted in noise volume by your individually connected device, you are left with a ring tone set to the same volume as your YouTube video or conversely the YouTube video resumes as loudly as the call and that is mildly annoying.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"AverageListener \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Great upgrade to an already great product\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"June 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products. Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling. The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good. I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal. I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great. There are other new features that you have to get used to: - the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful - similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane! Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it. Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time! Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up. In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GrenA \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"The BEST just got BETTER!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony has done it yet again; they\\u2019ve actually improved upon what I feel are the BEST noise cancelling wireless over-ear headphones available! The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions\\u2026and updated the look to a more modern design. What\\u2019s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case\\u2026which is a good size for traveling. They fit perfectly in the outside pocket of my backpack. The earphones were fully charged out of the box, so all that\\u2019s needed to get started (optional really, as they headphones will connect to your Bluetooth device anyway) is download the Sony Headphones Connect app and set up the earphones. There was a software update available for the headphones and it updated once they were connected. Fit and Function - The first thing I noticed was the new sleeker, more modern looking and lighter design of the XM5s. Although the design has changed, the comfort level is as plush and comfortable as ever. The ear cups and headband are super plush and easy to adjust to your head size. I've been wearing them almost non-stop for the last couple of days and there are no hotspots or uncomfortable rubbing. Hold the power button for a couple of seconds and then the magic starts, the noise canceling technology is fantastic, literally cutting out all the background noise as I mowed the lawn, went running or just listening to music while working around the house (my wife texts me as I can't hear her!). With the Auto Switching Based on Action, the noise cancelling level adjusts to your activity and the outside noise. Sound Quality - The sound quality is the BEST I've ever heard from Bluetooth NC headphones. Straight out of the box these things rock, but the Headphone Connect app gives the user the ability to set custom preferences for sound and services. From a noise canceling perspective Sony touts 8 total microphones and a newly designed 30mm driver to provide optimized noise canceling performance. So the 1000XM5s provide industry leading noise canceling and music that is so crisp and clear on the highs and the bass is rich and deep. Quality sound as expected from Sony! Headphone Connect App - it's a great tool for taking advantage of the many settings these headphones provide like Adaptive Sound Control, Noise Canceling Optimizer, Surround, Equalizer, Sound Quality Mode, Voice Assist, etc. Open the app, turn on the headphones and hold them close to connect and you\\u2019re ready to customize the earphones. The app is broken into four sections: Status, Sound. System and Services. Some of the functions are automatic like the Adaptive Sound Control - this will detect your surroundings and adjust the headphones accordingly. You can also select the Noise Canceling levels. The System tab is all about the operational settings like Auto Power Off, Touch Sensors, etc. Super easy to use and a great tool that\\u2019s very well laid out for the user. Cool (and totally useful) Functions - Not only do these headphones rock, they are loaded with super cool and totally useful Touch Features so you can adjust the music level, FF, Pause, answer phone calls, etc. by simply touching the right ear cup. And if that isn't enough, Sony has upped the game by adding Speak-To-Chat which stops the music and let\\u2019s in ambient sound so you can hold a conversation without having to take the earphones off or cover the right earphone (which still works) as the previous version supported. The other new function that really stands out to me is the Automatic Off (Wearing Detection) feature. By simply taking the headphones off, music is instantly paused until they are put back on\\u2026then the music instantly starts up again automatically. Not sure how Sony will add more features to these headphones in the future\\u2026but I\\u2019m sure they will do something amazing! Phone Calls \\u2013 Sound is great both on the speaker and headphone sides. No complaints from anyone I\\u2019ve talked to on the headphones. Your music will start right back up once the call is ended. Totally hands free and couldn\\u2019t be any easier to use! Battery Life - As mentioned, they came fully charged and after multiple days of use, they are still at 60%...this absolutely crushes the battery performance of my other NC headphones. And on top of that, there\\u2019s a quick charge feature that adds 3 hours of charge in just 3 minutes. Worrying about battery life is completely off the table based on my experience to date. Pros: - Noise Canceling and Sound Quality are second to none - Support for connecting to 2 different devices simultaneously - Ease of adjustability of sound and functions - Touch & Automatic Controls - control your music, pause or call without ever touching your phone - Fit and comfort is outstanding, even after hours of use \\u2013 no hot spots - Sony\\u2019s Headphone Connect App give the user complete control over setup and functionality of headphones - Taking Phone Calls - crisp and clear even in a crowded room - Recycled packaging is a nod to the environment by Sony Cons: - The new case is a bit larger than in the past, not a huge issue, but something that stood out The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are by far one of my new favorite devices and would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for the BEST noise canceling and function-packed over-the-ear headphones available.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"mstanleynh \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"These might just be as good as it gets..........\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 30, 2022\", \"content\": \"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day. The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work. The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound. I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely. The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting! All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there?

These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right earcup, I think sensitivity may have been improved as sliding my finger up and down or across the cup face worked first time every time. Taking phone calls also worked very well, could hear my caller no problem and same for the person calling hearing me clearly. The voice pickup to temporarily pause music playing when talking to someone is nice to have as well and didn't let me down, can be activated/de-activated in the Sony app, your choice. As for sound quality, they are superb and is probably somewhat dependant on quality of the music files played. If you can play Flac/Lossless files using LDAC audio then you will love them as Sony have clearly done work on improving all aspects of the sound stage. I have played Classical, Pop, Rock and Electronic music files and in my opinion the instrument separation from bass through middle to treble was much clearer, especially in the top range. Bass wasn't overbearing, but you can make it so from your sound source and it might overtake the mid to high notes, but everyone has their own preference, just saying you can boom the bass if you want it. All in all I think Sony have a winner once again. If I was to find one thing I didn't like so much, it's the case. I know its a different setup to the folding 1000XM4's case which I really like, albeit you can't fold that down flatter like the one provided with the 1000XM5. A minor niggle that doesn't detract from a great pair of headphones.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Mel2955 \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"content\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what\\u2019s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony\\u2019s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Cessnatim \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17653315832884157286/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:8676632268192045111_0,pid:18209137397974619706,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSoYCg2pf-AhW2EFkFHUNKA0gQqSQIbA\", \"title\": \"So far, so good.\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"December 11, 2022\", \"content\": \"These are an early Christmas present for me, the first over-ear wireless headphones I\\u2019ve had, chosen because of the reviews testifying to very good sound quality, good noise cancellation, comfort and battery staying power. I\\u2019ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside. Mostly I\\u2019ve listened to music but I\\u2019ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous. The human voice is a rich sound too, again with no apparent loss with even breathing audible on tracks where it was meant to be heard. Battery life seems very good. They arrived with about 60% charge and I recharged them when they got down to about 20% but that took about 10-14 days\\u2019 use of maybe 2 hours a day. No idea whether that\\u2019s good in comparison to others but certainly good enough for me. The set up was easy, noise cancellation is excellent from what I can make out, but I find the ability to pause this temporarily to head what someone is saying to me particularly helpful - just hold a hand over the right earpiece, ambient sound is restored very quickly and clearly, remove the hand and the music resumes. The headphones are comfy to wear, easy to adjust and while not tight, they seem to stay out so far when I\\u2019m bending down. The only very minor negative is that my ears get quite warm after I\\u2019ve worn them for about 1-2 hours, so I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d want them on for really extended periods. But that would be the same or worse for all headphones so no difference for these and I suspect other models might not be as comfortable. It\\u2019s true there are no free lunches and you get what you pay for, but with these I feel I\\u2019ve got good value for money. They come in a protective case which also contains the charging cable, and the app might be useful for connoisseurs wanting to tweak the set up but I\\u2019ve just used them with my music app on the phone. So, I\\u2019d say so far, so good.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Jeff Foot \\u00b7 Review provided by sony.co.uk\"}], \"description\": {\"product_title\": \"Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise-Canceling Wireless Over-Ear Headphones (Silver)\", \"product_description\": \"The WH-1000XM5 headphones rewrite the rules for distraction-free listening.

\"title\": \"Premium Sound\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 1, 2022\", \"content\": \"Bose has always been known to make audio products of the highest quality, And Bose\\u2019s newest earbuds the Quietcomfort Earbuds II do NOT disappoint. Packaging: Everything comes included in a small box, right away you can tell that the packaging was very well thought out and designed. Included in the box: Is a USB-A to USB-C cable, an upgrade to the older micro USB-B cable, so I liked that. Also inside the box you will find three different tips that are placed on the earbuds themselves, they come in small, medium and large, already installed are the medium sized ones, These fit the best for me. Also included are \\u201cbands\\u201d these bands wrap around the earbuds themselves. Basically what they do is they form a seal around your ear, These serve two purposes 1. they seal out outside noises out, and 2. They make the earbud fit perfect perfectly inside of your ear canal to protect against the ear buds falling out. Pairing: Connecting the earbuds to my smart phone was really easy, just press the button in the back of the charging case for a couple of seconds, pair them with your smart phone, and that\\u2019s it. Pretty standard and pretty easy. App: You\\u2019ll soon be prompted to download the Bose app. I Recommend everybody do this for couple of reasons, you can play around with the sound EQ settings, you can know exactly how much charge your earbuds have, you can program and swap different shortcuts, and the app can show you very well detailed tips on how to work your new earbuds, meaning it\\u2019ll show you how to pause your music, skip to the next song and raise or lower the volume by simply touching the side of the earbuds with your finger. Finally the thing I appreciate most about this app is that it doesn\\u2019t require you to create any kind of account if you don\\u2019t want to. Sound: The sound is as good as I have ever heard earbuds sound, clean, crisp, excellent highs, excellent mids, and the bass is good enough (these are not super bass heavy) there\\u2019s not much else to say really, these just sound great. Noice Cancelling: Perhaps the single greatest feature of these earbuds have is their sound canceling ability. When in \\u201cQuiet\\u201d mode, The earbuds block out sound better than any earbuds I have ever tried before, then there\\u2019s \\u201cAware\\u201d turn this on if you still want to listen to your music but still be able to hear outside noises (like if you are out in the street and still want to hear cars coming) I think what happens here is the microphone gets turned on and you\\u2019re then able to then hear the outside noises this way, kind of like a hearing aid. Both Quiet mode and Aware mode work very well. Conclusion: I recommend Bose\\u2019s newest earphones to anybody that is reading my review and interested in this product, you will be happy with your purchase. I highly recommend downloading the app and downloading the newest software update for them for the best experience. + Sound + Design + Features +App +The Bands +Comfortable +Battery life -Charging case is made of plastic and feels somewhat cheap\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Ernesto \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Outstanding BOSE sound quailty\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"September 6, 2022\", \"content\": \"We\\u2019ve used a few earbuds in the past, always different brands and were never totally satisfied with the sound quality, \\u201cespecially me with some hearing issues\\u201d. Bose has come out with a new model of the Quietcomfort earbuds, the \\u201cII\\u201d model was just released, and we decided to give them a try. Unboxing and setup: The earbuds come in a very small Bose logoed box, and inside there\\u2019s a charger case, \\u201cwith the earbuds nestled inside\\u201d, a USB C charging cable, sm/lg eartips, sm/lg stability bands \\u201cthe medium was already on the buds\\u201d, a quick start guide and a small but surprisingly thick manual in multiple languages. The first thing I did was to plug in the charging cable \\u201chave plenty of USB C ones already so didn\\u2019t bother with the OEM one, let them charge up and proceeded to start syncing. We also installed the Bose Music Android App before proceeding. Synching on our Samsung phones was simple, just open the lid to the charger, press the button on the back of the case/charger so the blue light blinks on the front then search/pair on your phone. Once we did that and the Bose app found them it immediately showed there was an update, so we let that proceed \\u201cwhich does take a few minutes so just be patient\\u201d. After the earbuds were paired it was time to try them out. Now these buds are a little larger than the Samsung ones we have \\u201cnot by much\\u201d and they do stick down a little more than them too, but once you find your fit they are just as comfortable \\u201cmaybe a little bit better IMO\\u201d, they didn\\u2019t feel like they were going to fall out easily and the app has a test you can run to be sure they are seated correctly. I do like to that they don\\u2019t actually turn on till one of them \\u201cright for us\\u201d is inserted and then you\\u2019ll hear the voice prompt confirming and battery charge. Use: We were both totally blown away by the sound quality, there\\u2019s even plenty of bass for us, and having any bass in a earbud is a pretty tough feat. Naturally it\\u2019s not chest pounding bass but it\\u2019s more than enough to give the feeling of nice deep bass, and that\\u2019s adjustable in the EQ of the App. We also like that you can adjust the noise cancellation can be adjusted from 0 \\u201cnone\\u201d to 100 \\u201cmax cancellation\\u201d, with it turned up to 100 I couldn\\u2019t make out what my wife was saying standing right in front of me, the same with her when she was wearing them, which was a little odd but easily adjusted so you can at least make out some background noise. These would be perfect in a very noisy environment as long as you don\\u2019t need to hear what\\u2019s going on around you. There are also multiple presets \\u201cmodes\\u201d that you can pick from and even customize your own. There\\u2019s also a setting in the noise cancellation that uses what BOSE calls \\u201cActive Sense\\u201d, it\\u2019s under the \\u201cAware\\u201d mode, and it will adjust the cancellation for loud noises so it will protect your hearing from very loud noises. It actually worked pretty well when I ran the vacuum cleaner, I could tell the sound was muffled but as soon as I turned it off I could hear the background noises again, \\u201cpretty neat\\u201d. I went outside and did some light yard work and only once did one of the buds come out a little, and that caused the sound to pause, so you know it\\u2019s not inserted correctly, an easy slight twist put it right back in. I contributed that to sweat running around my ears as it was 108F out and after a few minutes out in that anyone is going to be sweating. I\\u2019ve never had earbuds fit as well as these, most of the time I would just quit using them halfway through a project as they kept popping out due to sweat. As for call quality, neither of us had issues hearing calls, everyone said they heard us clearly and even with my hearing issues I could easily make out what everyone was saying. I will say I wish the equalizer could be adjusted for each earbud individually. My right ear is my troublemaker, and it would be nice to be able to adjust the equalizer separately so I could fine tune them. These actually sound much better than my Siemens hearing aids, and they don\\u2019t cost nearly as much. Listening to music is no compairson with them, and I usually use a full headphone to get full sound with the Bose I can get the same effect. The controls are easy to use, the outside of the main piece that sticks out \\u201csort of a oblong pill shape\\u201d , is the touch sensitive control. You can swipe up/down for volume, tap twice to advance track, three taps reverses and one tap pauses, pretty simple. You can answer calls with a single tap, and The only issue I had there is the touch area is very sensitive and it\\u2019s very easy to bump when you reach up to adjust the buds or try a function. Grabbing them gently by the sides and not bumping the touch sensitive area can be a little difficult at times but I\\u2019m sure it just takes some practice, but you have to be careful till you get used to them. Conclusion: We\\u2019ve never owned earbuds that actually sound as good as these, and the noise cancellation is simply amazing.

Took me a while to get them fitting how I liked, especially as the fitment was different to the usual wired earbuds I've used for years, with the ear canal piece being more rectangular than circular. Eventually got them sitting right and the fitment does actually feel better than what I've been used to. Saying that, I often get this little nagging feeling that the left earpiece is going to come loose, and yet it's very much firmly in place if I try to move it about. Tried various combinations of the different sized accessories with no real improvement, but it's a minor quibble, especially as I've used these for home workouts successfully; they've certainly never come close to falling out or anything like that. Noise-cancelling is decent. A lot is made of how class-leading these are in that respect, and I certainly don't think they're anything less than very good in that department, but in terms of blocking out outside noise when there's no audio playing, I don't think they're a clear step-up over what I've been used to. Audio quality is good; definitely an improvement over my various pairs of earbuds I've had, although no better than a pair of popular wireless headphones I have, but then those have much larger drivers, so perhaps an unfair comparison. Only mentioning because I saw someone mention elsewhere that they replaced their OE headphones with a pair of earbuds, and I don't think I'd be doing that myself; these QC IIs are very much for situations where bigger headphones aren't really suitable, such as going outside or exercising/running etc. Bluetooth connection/App seems stable, not had any connectivity issues so far. Actually went into the garage and forgot to take my phone with me, but the signal was still fairly stable, even though I was quite some distance from the source and had several doors/buildings blocking the signal potentially, so I'd have no concerns about dropouts in normal usage, impressive in that regard. Touch controls are simple and effective, although the pause/resume function does \\\"feel\\\" a bit laggy, but that may well be to do with ensuring pausing/resuming gestures aren't mixed up with the next/previous track function. Not a big deal as audio stops promptly if you tap the earbuds, I just have to remind myself to give them a few seconds to resume when I tap them again. I do wish there was a little audio beep or something when adjusting the volume as there is with my headphones. Although speaking of volume, these do need to be at a higher volume level than what I'm used to with other headphones/earbuds that I wear.

I have gone through a number of ear buds from a range of companies some premium and some more mainstream and always found the sound quality lacking in earbuds style as opposed to over ear designs. When I received my earbuds they were well packaged as you would expect the card case separates to reveal the various components of buds, case, cable and varying size buds and surround seals to ensure a good fit within the ear. As always frustratingly having opened the box everything needs charging so no fun for the first night! Within the pack is the QR code to download the Bose software for both IOA and android devices. Once charged and with software installed the setup was incredibly easy, it found the buds without having to go to settings find devices add pairing codes etc they just connected and then the software guided through the fitting phase to ensure the correct buds and surrounds were fitted. The sound test suggested everything was good to go. WOW was my first impression of sound quality, these little buds really had some good bass, within the app there is an equaliser which lets you change the base mid and treble and I am the sort of person that loves more Bass and Treble. these earbuds did not disappoint in sound quality for sure. Next came the programming of tap which in comparison to other models is more limited as there is basically a choice of which ear for the two settings, double taps, long taps etc are not catered for in this part of the app. The next test was for noise counselling which I have only ever found work fully on over the ear designs at premium prices. The noise cancellation in a normal environment is actually really good for these, it does not cancel everything but it certainly makes a difference and more so than other buds I have had in the past from premium brands. The only fault I have found is when cycling or running in wind conditions this is replicated as white noise slightly while listening to music. I think the only thing I have been disappointed with is the inability to charge the case wirelessly unless I have an incompatible charger this is not a feature of these earbuds as there was no evidence of charging no matter how I laid down the case and this is something I assumed would be the case. Overall these are the best earbuds I have owned so far, they compare with other brands but will still not beat over the ear!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"GEG87 \\u00b7 Review provided by bose.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Another flagship wireless earbuds from Bose\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"December 28, 2022\", \"content\": \"Designing appearances: First of all, the improvement of the charging box is particularly obvious. The charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II returns from the jewelry box style of the previous generation to the design direction of the mainstream TWS earphone charging box, resulting in a smaller size. What's more interesting is that the battery life of the charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II has been upgraded in spite of the reduced size! Wearing experience: The earplugs have undergone substantial alterations. Bose QC Earbuds II divided the previous generation of fish fin earplugs into two sections, the eartips and the stability bands, and called it \\\"Fit Kit ear kit\\\" The meaning of the Fit Kit is to solve the problem of ear fit for different users. You may encounter a certain type of noise-canceling earphones that are recognized as excellent in noise-canceling, but it feels average when it comes to you. The reason for this is probably that the earphones are not well adapted to your ear shape. After all, everyone's ear shape is different, and many people even have differences between their left and right ears. Noise-cancelling capability: Everyone who is familiar with the working principle of noise-cancelling headphones knows that the headphones will analyze and collect sound waves from the external environment, and create a reverse sound wave in the ear to cancel. The current flagship noise-cancelling headphones on the market perform very well in this regard. The Bose QC Earbuds II went a step further on this basis, focusing on the part of the ear, and made a smart in-ear sound field adjustment technology. When you insert the earbuds, you will hear a tone, which means that the smart in-ear sound field adjustment is working. At this time, it will automatically analyze the structure of the wearing ear canal, and then optimize the noise cancellation effect and sound quality of the earphones, thereby realizing \\\"volume customization\\\". Sound quality: The official description, the sound concept of Bose QC Earbuds II is balanced. After actual listening, I personally think it is true. The first impressions are incredibly supple and enduring. Each of the three frequency bands is fairly orderly, and nobody is trying to steal the show. Summarize: If you are looking for noise reduction and wearing comfort, Bose QC Earbuds II will not disappoint you!\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"JC \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"A music producers opinion\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"March 15, 2023\", \"content\": \"After ditching my old amazon bought earbuds and wearing over the had headphones for the better part of a year or so, I finally decided to get myself new earbuds. After about a month of research into what's on offer today I decided to use the 90-day risk free trial that is offered directly from Bose and go for the QC2, which are easily one of the most expensive earbuds you can buy, so do you get what you pay for? Yes. But here is my breakdown of all the features, from someone who has been producing and making music in studios for over a decade, I know a little thing or two about sound. So here goes. The Fit: Having the option between 3 different ear tip buds and 3 different wing bands leaves you with a good amount of choice in finding the fit that works for you, initially I found a good fit and the earbuds stay pretty firm in my ears for the most part. They have yet to actually fall out but I do find myself adjusting the left earbud quite frequently, as I get the feeling that it's going to fall out. This is quite annoying but manageable, and will be different for each user. I'm confident you'll find a good enough fit. The earbuds are comfortable for long periods of time and I have worn them for working out and they do stay put, but again, I find myself adjusting them a bit. Overall 4/5. The sound: I was expecting great things from the sound but overall, it is okay. It certainly isn't the best I've experienced, but certainly not the worst. The tuning is very well balanced I think, and there's no unusual emphasis on the Bass which is what a lot of companies tend to do so you get a fairly equal sound. I do sometimes find the high ends to be a bit harsh, particularly when listening to distorted guitar solos (Metallica, Megadeth etc) but this isn't too often. I do wish the sound would go louder though, My old earbuds would go very loud before hitting that phone sound warning that said you are in hearing loss territories but the QC2 don't go very loud before hitting that threshold, I find myself on the highest setting before the mark which is annoying because sometimes you want that loudness. This is probably my biggest gripe in terms of the sound, as a musician I appreciate the overall balance that these earbuds provide, but again, for the absolute best sound experience there are probably better earbuds out there. Overall 4/5 The noise cancelling and aware mode: Easily the best noise cancelling I've personally ever experienced. The quiet mode setting, truly gets rid of the outside world, it is remarkable. I can walk down the street with the setting enabled, with cars roaring passed me and I barely notice they are there, I'm focused on the sound on my ears which is an absolute blessing. The aware mode, which simulates Apples transparency mode is okay, I find there to be quite a bit of unnatural white noise which can become a bit tiresome after a while but overall it does a decent job. It also has an automatic feature which dampens loud sound around you (for example a door slamming) which is quite cool, but feels a bit weird. The noise cancelling though? Excellent. Overall 5/5 The app: I'm really not the biggest fan of the app. It's plain, boring, uninspired and you really don't get a lot from it. There's some tips and 'tricks' on there that really just tell you how to get the best fit for your ears etc. It let's you set two more custom noise settings (letting you adjust the level of noise cancelling and aware mode levels.) There's an EQ which lets you adjust the Bass, Mids, and Highs on the earbuds but you only get 3 bands which compared to other sound apps (JBL for instance) is quite terrible. If you want to adjust the sound I would recommend using a separate app with more customising options. Most of the time I find the earbuds cannot connect to the app anyway and without the connection, you are unable to do anything on the app, rendering it completely useless. Overall once you've had a look at the app, set your EQ preferences and set your noise modes, you won't be using it much and it's quite forgettable. Overall I'd give these earbuds a 4/5. With a good fit, good sound, great noise cancelling and and okay app these earbuds are certainly up there in terms of what you can buy. I do however think they are overpriced. I personally just do not think they are that good to be charging one of the highest prices on the market for earbuds, if you can get these discounted then certainly go for it but at full price, I do think there are probably pretty good cheaper alternatives. If you're main buying point is noise cancelling though, you probably want to take the plunge on these though. Do I regret buying them? No, they are good.

These have such good noise cancelling that my wife came behind me while I was doing dishes talking to my and said I could hear her and was just pretending I couldn't hear her, but I really couldn't hear her..... Now for the negative, my wife owns a dog training business and there are a lot of dogs that bark, it does a good job blocking out the barking except the very high pitches which you hear a popping sound, which I heard from interference with certain manufacturer machines that have a high pitch sound also. I do dislike how the left earbud is slave to the right earbud, which means you can't use the earbuds independently, with the right earbud being the master bud. But hopefully they will fix this with a futures update. But what I do LOVE and these earbuds is that I can pause, play, volume up/down, move track forward/backwards, and move between the different ANC seeing simultaneously with the right earbud. This is a phenomenal feature that I believe these are the only earbuds that have. They have definitely improved the Bass in this version and have superior sounds (Sony XM4's still have the best drivers but not much of a difference between these and Don't). Case size is normal for this price range, the obly 2 downsizes is no wireless charging (which I normally never use) and that the earbuds are not magnetic, sometimes they don't get a good connection to charge, but doesn't happen too often). People do complain about the eartip design, which does take a little to get use to, but after having it for a couple weeks, it does help with the ANC. As far as it's shape, I LOVE it. The XM4's, Samsung, and Jabras I would accidently be pressing the buttons taking the earbuds in and out, with these I can mess with them without worrying, which is a stress relieve. Battery life, they are not as good as Jabras, which have the best battery life I have tried yet, but after Jabra, they are are average for the price range. They ANC does drain the battery but as much as other brands, but worth it for how good the ANC is. Price range, the price is about right for what you are getting. Final words, they are the best wireless earbuds I have owned out of multiple brands for what I need. If you want best sound quality, go with the Sony XM4'S the 2022 version, not the /B version (which is having battery drain issues right now due to firmware update). If you want top of the line earbuds in budget I would go with either Jabra or Samsung, which both are GREAT earbuds. But the BOSE have THE BEST ANC, have all controls on the right earbud, great sound quality, and come from a good company. Do they have everything I want? NO, but I won't find an earbud that does. Do I sometimes question these earbuds, yes. Would I buy these again, in a heartbeat. So if you want an overall top of the line for earbuds, these are great! The only reason that I don't give them 5 stars is due to the periodically popping sound, which other earbuds have also (Sony, Dr. Dre) but should be able to be fixed in a software update, which when that happens I will give 5 stars and I am a rough at rating, my wife can tell you that.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"techsavy \\u00b7 Review provided by bestbuy.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"Don't buy Bose at any cost!\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"January 7, 2023\", \"content\": \"I originally bought the Quiet Comfort earbuds in January 2022 which needed replacing and repair about 4 times in a few months (which obviously took up A LOT of time with the admin of talking to JL and going into store etc), until the last time they got sent away where I was told there'd be a week turn around to receive another new pair. Fast forward 6 weeks and they're still 'in progress'. Had to speak to JL (and Bose) directly to find out they had no stock to send my replacement. I was about to give up and get a refund when I suggested I'd try the upgraded pair if JL would offer me that free of charge, which they kindly did (\\u00a330 difference). I received the QC II and had similar problems, left bud always draining of charge or not fully charging, the sound warping between both earbuds, the microphone picking up too much background noise so phone calls outside meant the recipient was not able to hear me, as well as trouble connecting to my phone on every start up, taking about 5-10 mins, putting them back in their case, restarting Bluetooth, opening and closing the app etc. Very inconvenient on the go. Alongside all these defects, the design was off for me. In order to scroll through various noise cancelling levels you can't just hold your finger on the earbud (which also, by the way, didn't fit in my ear properly so fell out multiple times, so-much-so I avoided wearing them when moving a lot), you have to press for ~2 seconds then release for ~2 seconds then press again etc to go through your various modes, which I felt was generally impractical and annoying, especially as it didn't respond to heavy touch but equally didn't with too light a touch. It also meant the right one was even more likely to fall out of my ear. It also made me look like a wannabe Spy. The noise cancelling also broke on the first few pairs I had, and a high pitched whining noise existed when not listening to music. To operate the volume control it requires a swipe, but it never seem to respond properly and would often pause my music or end the call I was on (which is actually the double tap function). All in all, it was a terrible purchase I wish I'd never made, but it was made slightly simpler by the fact the in-store John Lewis Tech team in Bristol made the return easy for me and were very helpful. I am now sworn off Bose for good (I also have a portable speaker which has connective and sound quality issues) but the silver lining is that I would purchase from JL again, knowing that my purchase was protected.\\u00a0\", \"source\": \"Kitty \\u00b7 Review provided by johnlewis.com\"}, {\"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY-Ouf2pf-AhWrFlkFHcCUB14QqSQIfA\", \"title\": \"amazing sound quality. lacks some features\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"October 5, 2022\", \"content\": \"I rate these headphones a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the sound quality but I have a few things I'm disappointed in especially because of the price point. i really wish the bose name wasn't so large on the side of the earbud it's so distracting wish it was maybe smaller or on an edge. it has no wireless charging BUT that means it weighs less not an issue for me. there is no indication on the case that says anything about the battery and its a bigger case than other types of wireless earbuds but significantly smaller than past bose cases so that's good. there isnt a button that allows you to open the case which means that the case opens too easily also from my experience. the magnets don't really help the case stay closed. the process to pair it is a little difficult. first of all you have to have the app which i don't like and a lot of other wireless headphone don't need an app but if you want to customized your sound quality these are a great option.i like the ear buds that just pair with the phone by Bluetooth but this is definitely very technical The best part about these headphones is that they do live up to the Bose name in terms of noise canceling. It feels like it adjusts to the sound intensity. The quality of calling people is good also because it's very clear. I do agree that the charging time for the earbuds lasts about 6 hours with no issues. Again, you can customize the sound quality on the app. As most earbuds, these come with 3 different soft silicone ear tips and 3 stability bands but for the price I do think there need to be even more tip options for a good fit for everyone These look big in my ears but I was suprised they aren't heavy. I do wish that again for the price point that they would come with the option of over the ear holders too. It seems big but they do have a lot of features especially the swiping on the outside of the earbud wide portion that's unique and there's enough room for your finger to slide easily and a groove to know when to stop You do need to use certain functions on certain earbud and not that can be done on either one. The quiet and aware modes are unique and I'm glad there two options, you may need to play around to get used to them. I personally like the aware mode as it allows for more background noise to get in and I can still pay attention to other things, but there is an area you can change the noise cancelation and tailor it. I think you can only use the voice feature on the right earbud. you can't use one earbud independent of another at the moment uless you leave both outside the case but i did read it may become Available in an update. you also have to be careful with the amplifying power of these earbuds because some sounds are so loud in your ear. personally i do not walk around with earbuds i only use them to work out but would definitely not wear these all the time if I was looking for that option without removingsome of the noise canceling because its so intense almost like wearing earplugs.

You know it's working as each bud plays a short note before announcing the device it's paired with, and that announcement goes from being a tad muffled to crystal-clear in the space of a second or less, as the NC is adjusted. Sound Quality The Bose buds have a beefy sound that's underpinned with solid bass, not muddy in any way. The top end can be shrill but is easily moderated with the in-app equalizer. The noise cancellation really helps by removing all distractions and allowing you to focus on the music, it might not be audiophile quality but it is very satisfying. Noise Cancelling Just amazing. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 which were, until now, pretty much unbeatable. The Boses handily trump them. There is some hiss if you have them NC on with no music, in a quiet room, but in any other scenario they are a miracle made flesh, they simply erase what's going on around you better than any other headphone I've heard. The 'aware' mode is great too, people talk about the Apple Airpods Pro as having the best but these are in the same division, passed through noise sounds very natural and that mode doesn't make the music sound tinnier as some others I've heard do. Battery life Good, or rather, normal. 6 hours-ish plus 2 more charges from the case with NC on all the time. Fit and comfort Good, if unusual. There is a pack containing 3 sets of rings and 3 sets of ear tips, the rings help to hold the buds in place and form a seal, the tips do what tips normally do and you can get a perfect fit by mixing and matching them.

i've recently decided that i need to get better at focusing and so obviously a pair of noise cancelling headphones is the way to guarantee this and so in this video we're going to be testing these top six noise cancelling headphones to figure out which of these is the best on the market and which of these i am going to buy for myself now the cool thing is we actually have a whole range of these in different price points we have the ridiculously cheap anchor sound cores we have the microsoft surface headphone 2. we have the sony wh xm 1000 m4 or something like that we have the bose qc700s we have the apple airport max and we have the stupidly expensive b and o b o plate h95 and so for each of these what we did is that i tested them extensively myself and we got a few team members to test them all as well and we're going to rate them all in terms of aesthetics in terms of fit and comfort in terms of noise cancellation and in terms of sound quality for music now as you know i'm a fan of upfront conclusions so i'm just going to come out and say that the ones i'll be getting are the sony wh mx4s whatever they're called if you're on a budget the anker sound cores are actually surprisingly reasonable and if you don't care about long-term comfort and are happy to spend a bit more money the apple airpods maxes are the choice for you so if that's all you wanted from the video then thank you very much for watching and do please have a great rest of day but now we're going to go over these one at a time and i'm going to share the pros and the cons of each of these six pairs of headphones and i'll show the results of my personal and our team testing about the various factors so that whichever one of these you're buying you can make hopefully a slightly more informed decision about the noise canceling headphones that are obviously going to change your life so we're going to start with the cheapest ones and these are the anker soundcore q30s which retail for about 100 and if you're on a budget these are actually a really good option and probably the best value for money that you can get in terms of the noise cancellation headphone wireless headphone market their design is a little bit plasticky and flimsy and they come with this sound core case thing which again is nothing to write home about it's got these little cheapy cheap looking pieces of foam in it as well but to be honest for the price it's not bad at all in terms of fit and comfort it's actually pretty reasonable in terms of looks these did get the lowest rating from our team members and from me with most of us rating it either a one or two for an average rating of 1.5 stars in terms of looks but in terms of fit and comfort they're actually pretty reasonable and most of us rated them a four or three so this got a rating of 3.5 in terms of fit and comfort now when it comes to noise cancellation i'm gonna be honest like i tested these fairly extensively and i didn't really notice much of a difference between the noise cancelling capabilities of the different headphones in fairness we are in this fairly quiet environment if i was in an airplane or on a train or in the london underground maybe the noise cancelling test would have been better but as far as i could really tell they were all fairly similar in terms of noise cancelling ability but in terms of sound quality there were some noticeable differences between the six headphones in the lineup the sound is pretty good but i'm not like wowed by it i'm still getting that kind of like cheap feel and these ones clocked in fairly reasonably with an average rating of 3.75 stars across our team the battery life on these is absolutely incredible it's 40 hours apparently with noise cancelling and 60 hours if you turn off the noise cancelling and they've got a few buttons on the bottom where you can increase the volume or decrease the volume or hit play and pause again these are nothing to write home about but if for example you're a student and you're on a budget and you do want a pair of noise cancelling headphones to make it easier to focus when you're working or if you're in a coffee shop or whatever then these are by far the best value for money and they also fall down nicely and can go kind of go into this case and you can shove this little piece of plastic in there somewhere if you really want to but yeah fairly reasonable option if you are on a budget moving up a little bit in terms of price point we now have the microsoft surface headphones too which retail for around about 270 dollars now in terms of aesthetics i actually quite like these especially because they're this sort of silvery whitey kind of color and i'm a fan of things that look white broadly and they have these interesting features in that on both knobs you can like turn the knobs so one of the knobs is full volume and the other knob is for the noise cancellation ability of the headphones allegedly they have multi-device support and so they can connect to two devices at once and allegedly it can switch between your iphone and your macbook if it recognizes you're getting a phone call in practice this feature does not work like it has never once actually worked as intended for me and in terms of battery life it's fairly low it's got around about 18 hours of battery life which means you do have to charge it somewhat regularly if you're going to be using it extensively for long work sessions in terms of aesthetics i gave this a five star rating but some of the team gave it a three and four star so the average rating of this was four stars and in terms of fit and comfort it's actually very reasonable i've got fives and fours across the board with an average rating of 4.3 stars but sadly in terms of sound quality these are just not as good as some of the alternatives so i gave this personally a three out of five in terms of sound quality which was kind of what the team thought as well so this had an average rating of 3.3 stars in terms of music quality so i actually used to use these for about six months in 2021 and i really liked them mostly because of the aesthetic they were quite nice to be honest i hadn't a b tested them with a bunch of different headphones to be honest all these review videos are somewhat artificial because once you have one of these headphones it doesn't really matter which one you have you kind of then just get used to it and that becomes the new normal it's only when you really compare them side by side with like kind of six other headphones that you start to quibble about things like noise quality but broadly i was a big fan of them um when i had them and i like the fact that they came with this nice little case which meant i could just chuck it in my bag and the case had a nice little slot for the cables as well then sadly my tesla got broken into and these got stolen so this is just a pair that we ordered for review purposes but after testing them side by side with all the others i've decided that i'm no longer going to be using the microsoft surface headphones too because the sonys are just a little bit better than them across all fronts except the aesthetics anyway that brings us on to the sony what are they called the sony wh-1000xm4s this is the only real problem with these is that it's impossible to remember what the name is sony really needs to come up with a better way of naming these headphones but they are the ones that i'm going to be now switching to because i think they're the perfect mix of comfort and sound quality and noise cancellation and battery life even if the aesthetic is just slightly less nice than the microsoft surface headphones too now in terms of fit and comfort these actually were the best headphones that we tested they were the most comfortable buy a reasonable margin decent very comfortable most comfortable yet and i think the main reason for that is that these are just so light they are i think probably the lightest out of the six headphones that we've tested although i haven't measured it just on my head they feel really light and when it comes to wearing these for extended periods of time really the comfort correlates strongly with how heavy the headphones are or rather how light the headphones are because the main problem with the airpods max for example like they're amazing in sound quality they're amazing in battery life they're amazing across all fronts it's just that they're really heavy and after like an hour of using them my head starts to hurt from having such heavy headphones on it and so the fact that the sony's are so comfortable to wear for very extended periods of time i think it's mostly down to just how light they are in terms of looks yeah they're not bad the team thought they were five stars and four stars in terms of looks i'd personally rate them a three star because i do prefer the look of the microsoft surface headphones but i mean they're very reasonable they look like just a normal pair of noise cancelling headphones nothing to write home about and in terms of design they fold up nicely like this so it's very easy to pack into a bag and they also come with this little carry case that if you want you can put them in i'm probably not going to do that because that's too much faff i'm just probably going to stick them in my bag exactly like that they charge like all these do by usbc that's pretty standard and unsurprisingly they've got a power button and a button that lets you control the level of noise cancellation in terms of battery life these are actually really good they're advertised as having 30 hours of battery life with the noise cancellation and 38 hours without noise cancellation if you're not into noise cancellation for whatever reason and in terms of sound quality for listening to music i personally thought these were really good i gave them a four star rating sadly this was not mirrored by our team who thought they were more like two stars and three stars in terms of noise quality and so the overall rating for this in terms of sound quality is 3.5 stars but personally i think that's a little bit of an under estimate of what's the actual i say actual my my personal subjective interpretation of their their music quality was and to be honest this sort of subjectiveness you get a lot when it comes to testing headphones like i'm not an audiophile no one in our team is really an audiophile and so we don't objectively know what these headphones sound like all we can say is what our subjective experience like oh this sounds a bit better than that and after doing a bunch of hot swapping to be like are these really sounding better than the surface are these really sounding better than the boses i kind of decided at the end that like yeah whenever i put these on my head i felt ah these are so comfortable and i also felt that oh the sound quality on these is pretty good yeah not as good as the airpods max airplanes backs max wins across the board just blew everyone else out of the water in terms of sound quality but i don't think that trade-off is warranted given how heavy they are and therefore how uncomfortable they are for long periods of time at least for me and so the sony's are the ones that i'm going to be holding on to i haven't figured out whether i want them in white or silver or in blue i'm not too much of a fan of this matte black color but hey they're really good and these are now going to be a staple part of my everyday carry all right now we're spending a little bit more money and we come to the bose qc 700s which retail for 350 but these are a little bit more expensive than the sony's and actually i think the main selling point is the look it does look quite nice um our team was a bit uh split on whether we liked this particular style with these like yeah it's just a slightly different design to most noise cancelling headphones i personally quite like them but in terms of comfort they're not quite as good as the sony's and in terms of sound quality for me also they're not quite as good as the sony's our team rated these pretty poorly across the board so this got an average of 3.25 stars when it came to fit and comfort it got a three stars in terms of noise cancellation and it got a 3.1 stars in terms of sound quality and a 3.2 stars in terms of look so like broadly if we averaged the four four five four four team members that we had testing these broadly we weren't a fan these are actually the ones i've been using for the last six months since my tesla got broken into and i lost my microsoft surface headphones too i've actually been using these but i'm going to give them away to a friend and instead replace them with the sony's because the sony's are marginally better in terms of comfort and in terms of sound quality next we come to the apple airpod maxes which are really expensive and retail for around about 640 dollars at least if you convert the pounds we'll put the actual dollar price over here now these come with the case but we have two team members gordon angus in our studio who use these and they never carry the case with them similarly when i used to use the apple airpods max i never carry the case because the case is totally pointless and genuinely these are really good the sound quality is just way better than all of the other headphones that we tested and when you put these on you immediately think oh my god this sounds incredible compared to the other noise cancelling headphones and anyway it kind of screws up your mind a bit or your ear rather because it makes you think that the others sound bad in comparison to this but then after a while of getting used to the others you stop you you kind of forget what it was like to wear the apple airpods max this is probably the best sounding of them all the sound is amazing the design is a bit polarizing i quite like the blue color personally rather than the black and they've got this little mesh thing at the top which is kind of comfortable but the main thing the main drawback of these as i've said is that they're just too heavy they're very comfortable for short amounts of time but for more than about half an hour i started to find my kind of ears getting a bit tired my head getting a bit tired maybe i'm not hench enough to handle these but i just i just really wasn't a fan in terms of long-term comfort levels now if you have apple devices these are actually really good because there is a chip or something inside them that makes them pair with iphones and macs really easily so you can literally just wear them and they will automatically pair to your iphone or to your mac and really that means that there isn't actually a way of turning them off the way they go into standby mode is when you put them in the case but given that realistically no one really carries the case around because it's kind of useless it does have that slight quirk to them it's got a little button at the top which acts as a little sort of volume dial and also if you press the button down you can access siri but the issue is that these are the only phones that don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so if you listen to stuff on airplanes a lot and you want to plug your headphones into the aeroplane system thingy so that you can watch a movie on the aeroplane using your fancy noise canceling headphones you can do that with all the others but you can't do it with the apple airpods max this is not a huge problem like to be honest these were the clear winners in most of the categories in terms of comfort so yeah great pair of headphones super expensive but you do get fantastic sound quality for that but they are not for me because i just can't handle them in terms of the heaviness and the discomfort and finally we come to the big daddies the b o b o play h95s which are ridiculously expensive these come in at 940 or thereabouts and they have they have these like leather thingies around them i think you can actually take these off yeah you can take them off they have leather around them they have this leather thing at the top so it's like a more premium higher end feel to these noise canceling headphones but sadly they are just not very good in terms of the aesthetics our team was a bit split on them i quite like these metal bits and i would have even liked the nordic ice color because these come in a multitude of colors and that color looks really cool but again they run into into the same issue that the airpods max do in that they are quite heavy and so wearing them for extended periods of time can actually get a little bit uncomfortable sound quality as well again it's reasonable most of our team rated them somewhere between three and four stars i would just thought that the sound would be better for this price so the sound quality doesn't feel amazing i thought these were a three star personally i did personally prefer the sound quality of the sony's despite the fact that these are like triple the price but i guess what you're really paying for here is the sort of more premium leather feel of the noise cancelling headphones and to be honest i liked the nordic ice color at least on the website so much that if these were slightly lighter i probably would have gone for these just to have the flecks of like having a really nicely aesthetic pair of headphones sadly they're not comfortable enough to even warrant that so basically i'm not a fan of these despite them being quite expensive and quite high-end oh the other cool thing about them is that they do come in this fancy like metal case thing which feels feels very high-end feels very premium makes you think feel healed oh sick but it's also a case that's quite heavy by itself and so it's not a case that you're really going to be carrying in a backpack it's more for the kind of aesthetics of the unboxing experience and so that you can feel oh i'm a legend because i wear bang olufsen noise canceling headphones now in terms of practical uses of these noise canceling headphones there's three main domains that have made up the bulk of my use of these over the last few years firstly it's listening to my study with me playlist on spotify while i'm trying to work or focus or do any kind of deep work at all second it's consuming things like music and podcast and audiobooks while i'm on things like trains and airplanes because the noise canceling is really helpful and thirdly i find these noise canceling headphones really helpful if i'm editing videos because then with the noise cancelling i can edit videos wherever i go and speaking of editing videos another tool that i find incredibly helpful is called storyblocks who are very kindly sponsoring this video i've been using storyblocks since i started this youtube channel five years ago in 2017. droidblocks is absolutely fantastic it is a subscription service that gives you royalty-free stock photos and stock videos and stock music that you can use in youtube videos just like this one in fact when we got team members to test out the headphones some of the tracks we were using were from storyblocks royalty free so that we can include them in this video without getting copyright stricken for them me and our editors personally find storyblocks super helpful when we're trying to find b-roll and especially in the early days of this youtube channel when i was trying to juggle making videos with the demands of being a medical student and later the demands of being a doctor it was super helpful to have this library of high quality stock footage available to use as b-roll so that i didn't necessarily have to go out and spend hours and hours shooting my own b-roll for all the videos that i was making and other than just videos and music storyblocks also has things like after effect templates and premiere pro templates for titles lower thirds transitions and even sound effects that you can incorporate into your videos whenever you want storyblocks has subscriptions for any budget and so if you want to check it out then do hit the link in the video description so thank you so much storyblocks for sponsoring this video and for helping out the channel over the last five years so overall when it comes to these headphones the budget pick is the anker sound cores which are very reasonable my personal pick is the sony wh mx1000 xm4s or whatever they're called and if you don't care about the comfort thing the airpods maxes are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality if you like this video you might be interested in what sort of podcasts i listen to with my fancy pair of noise cancelling headphones and that'll be in a video over there called 20 podcasts that made me millionaire so thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye \"}]",

Learn more. If you\\u2019re looking for the best headphones on the market, it\\u2019s tough to get a straight answer. What works for some people doesn\\u2019t work for others, and few product categories are as diverse as headphones. In-ears, on-ears, over-ears\\u2014there\\u2019s just so much to choose from, and it\\u2019s hard to tell what\\u2019s right for you. Editor\\u2019s note: This list was updated on March 10, 2023 to include the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless as a top pick, and the Beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X, Google Pixel Buds A-Series, Grado SR80x, Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, Sennheiser HD 660S2, and Shure SE215 in the Notable mentions, add isolation and frequency response charts for the AKG K371, and to update formatting. For our top five picks, you can find the isolation and frequency response charts at the end of each image gallery. You can learn more about how to read our charts here. Now that Sony has released the Sony WH-1000XM5, it takes the crown as the best active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones. This new model outperforms its closest competitors in noise attenuation and microphone quality. The default frequency response is a bit bassier than what we typically recommend, but you can easily equalize this from the Sony Headphones Connect app (iOS/Android) or your preferred third-party equalizer. To see frequency response and isolation charts for any of our top picks, scroll to the end of each photo gallery. The WH-1000XM5 offers top-of-the-line specs and features, including a custom equalizer, Sony\\u2019s 360 Reality Audio, and auto-pause/play sensors. The Sony WH-1000MX5 includes speak-to-chat, which pauses your media when you are speaking to someone and resumes playback 30 seconds after so you don\\u2019t miss the person\\u2019s response. You also have Bluetooth multipoint which is a great productivity feature for those who like to keep an ear on their phone while connected to their laptop. The microphone system is among the best we\\u2019ve seen in a headset like this and cancels out background noise effectively no matter the conditions. Take a listen to two of our microphone demos below! If the price tag of the WH-1000XM5 is just a bit too high, you also can\\u2019t go wrong with the older Sony WH-1000XM4, which was previously our pick for best noise cancelling headphones. When comparing the Sony WH-1000XM5 to the WH-1000XM4, it\\u2019s clear that these headphones are closely related. Even though the XM5 model has better ANC and sound quality to boot, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is still worth getting if you don\\u2019t want to spend as much money. The fourth-generation headset shares many of the premium features found on the WH-1000XM5 and you can expect the older model to go on sale. If you want a budget alternative, the Sony WH-XB910N is a solid ANC headset if you can find it. However, you\\u2019ll only save $100, as the price tag is most often around $250. The fact of the matter is that good ANC is tough to get at a good price, and Sony currently has the best. True wireless earphones took the market by storm after being dominated by the Apple AirPods for so long. Now there\\u2019s plenty of competition, much of which offers a more compelling experience than most of Apple\\u2019s audio products. However, with the company\\u2019s latest release, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is back on top of the pole for iOS users. These buds offer great ANC, sound quality to match, and sound better than the AirPods (3rd generation) simply by virtue of the fact that they can seal your ear canal. These earbuds bring a big improvement to ANC and battery life, and the retain the same IPX4 rating, which now also covers the charging case. Speaking of the charging case, that\\u2019s where a lot of the more notable changes come. The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) charging case features Apple\\u2019s new U1 chip, which makes it compatible with Apple\\u2019s Find My service and the new integrated speakers will emit a noise to help you find it. Much like all the other AirPods, this is best used with Apple devices. It only supports SBC and AAC Bluetooth codecs, so there\\u2019s no high quality codec for android users. Also, many of the earbuds software features are found in the iOS settings app, so you\\u2019ll miss out on other platforms in that respect too. Still, this is about as good as it gets for wireless earbuds for Apple users. The AirPods Pro mic sounds best in quiet environments but can filter out some background noise. Listen to our samples below. Sennheiser combines most of what you want in a great set of over-ear Bluetooth headphones in the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. With support for a variety of high quality codecs like AAC, aptX, aptX HD, and aptX Adaptive, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C listening, you\\u2019ll hardly ever get caught without a connection. You even get Bluetooth multipoint. More to the point, a stellar 56 hours and 21 minutes of battery life (with ANC on) outperforms most headphones. While the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless doesn\\u2019t beat out the Sony WH-1000XM5 on noise cancelling, the ANC onboard is still rather effective and adjustable. That sound experts at Sennheiser tune the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless to sound frankly great, is unsurprising. It gets very close to our target curve with just a bit more bass. However, if that sound is not your preference, you can utilize the Smart Control app to adjust EQ. In addition you can create automatic listening settings for different locations and adjust ANC. The touch controls are intuitive, and little luxuries like on-ear detection contribute to the overall flagship worthy experience of the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. That you get a carry case and an airplane adapter means you don\\u2019t have to shell out for accessories either. Plus, the Sennheiser cans undercut the price of most premium headphones without significant compromises. Sennheiser does a pretty good job with the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless, although, it has some issues with noise rejection, but nothing unusual for headphones without booms. Take a listen to the following demo recordings. Though people have been picking the Sony MDR-7506 for decades, a true successor in the \\u201cbudget monitor headphone\\u201d category has finally taken center stage. The AKG K371 offers a really good baseline for what constitutes good sound in the consumer market. That\\u2019s not because these are super bassy, or that they\\u2019re flashy\\u2014if anything they\\u2019re the opposite of both. This pair of headphones sounds excellent for what it is, and provides a really good double-life as a dependable studio monitor. Sure, these are a set of wired cans with a rather cumbersome cable. But if you\\u2019re listening at home, mixing a track, or working at the coffee shop: these are the headphones you want. Sure, you could spend thousands of dollars on headphones that may or may not sound better, but the HiFiMan Sundara is at the perfect crossroads between affordability and top-tier performance. Sure, that sounds a little weird to say for a set of $300 USD planar magnetic headphones, but our testing shows the Sundara does an excellent job at providing listeners with good sound quality when compared to its closest competitors. However, many headphones in this bracket are very heavy and uncomfortable, and the Sundara has this issue to an extent. However, the choice to use cloth in the padding of the ear cups and the form-fitting band do a lot to make this product far more comfortable to use for those who wear eyeglasses. If you don\\u2019t wear eyeglasses, all the better. Of course, as open-back headphones, these let in just about every sound around you. So be sure to note that before you start spending like crazy. Additionally, if you\\u2019d like to equalize these headphones any: you\\u2019re probably going to want an amplifier of some sort to avoid volume issues. While the ANC on the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 may not be as impressive as the company\\u2019s Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones, Bose has shown commitment to users by improving the ANC with a comprehensive firmware updates (version 1.8.2). You can view the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 ANC chart. We also like the NCH 700 for its sleek design and seemingly perfect touch controls. Many companies make calibrate their headsets\\u2019 touch panels to be too sensitive, resulting in many misfires, but Bose\\u2019s headset is a breeze to operate. The default frequency response (chart) is excellent and requires little fixing, but you can change it directly from the Bose Music app (iOS/Android) if you\\u2019d like. Those with unusually low voices may sound a bit \\u201coff\\u201d or \\u201chollow\\u201d to those on the other end but this is to mitigate the proximity effect. For the most part, the NCH 700 microphone is quite good in all contexts since it filters out quite a bit of environmental noise. If you\\u2019re looking for the absolute best way to spend money on headphones for the computer, Drop\\u2019s partnership with Sennheiser brought a legendary audiophile option\\u2014the HD 650\\u2014down to roughly half the original asking price with the HD 6XX. Budget-conscious audiophiles would be doing themselves a disservice by not giving these a spin. There are a few minor differences between the HD 6XX and the HD 650 ($304.78 at Amazon), but most are cosmetic in nature. The performance of the HD 6XX is top-notch, and is much lighter than it looks. If you\\u2019re the kind of listener who spends a lot of time at the computer, this is the kind of headphones you should be looking for. Just be aware that the open back is a double-edged sword: it allows for better sound quality and clarity, but it also lets in all the outside noise around you. We can\\u2019t highlight every headset the way we\\u2019d like, so instead, we\\u2019ve put together a bulleted list of alternative standouts that didn\\u2019t quite make the best headphones cut. Some of our picks\\u2019 frequency response and isolation charts were measured with our old testing system. We have since purchased a Bruel & Kjaer 5128 test fixture (and the appropriate support equipment) to update our testing and data collection. It will take a while to update our backlog of old test results, but we will update this article (and many others!) once we\\u2019re able with improved sound quality measurements and isolation performance plots. These will be made obvious with our new chart aesthetic\\u00a0(black background instead of white). Thank you for bearing with us, and we hope to see you again once we\\u2019ve sorted everything out. Calling something \\u201cthe best\\u201d at anything is controversial at best, so we create our best lists with the caveat that your experiences may vary from our own. Sometimes people have a unique set of needs, and that can\\u2019t be satisfied by going to a list of \\u201cbest headphones\\u201d because the article doesn\\u2019t address what the best headphones out there are\\u2026\\u00a0for you. Consequently, we encourage all of our readers to write down all the things they want out of their headphones first\\u2014before rolling the dice on a pick. This list has a lot of all-time greats, but if you need something a little bit more tailored to\\u00a0your needs, definitely keep reading our other lists and features to arm yourself with enough knowledge to make the right purchase. Think hard about what types of headphones you like (in ears? over ears? on ears?), and also try to figure out what features you need. Maybe you need to go to the store to see how they fit on your head? Do you wear glasses or have ear piercings? Maybe you should look into getting velour pads instead of leather! These are all things covered in our reviews and other best lists. This list has a few wired options if you want great sound, but we also have a few wireless options if you prefer convenience. If you opt for a Bluetooth pair, there are a few things you should know. First and foremost, the rumors you\\u2019ve heard are true. Bluetooth just can\\u2019t party with wired headphones, at least as it pertains to sound quality. Even some of the best codecs available aren\\u2019t as great as they seem at first glance. AAC is basically only good if you\\u2019re on an iOS device which means Android users should probably stick to aptX, and LDAC isn\\u2019t truly hi-res. The good news is that you most likely can\\u2019t hear any of the details in the data that\\u2019s being dropped, but it\\u2019s still not a great selling point. Of course, if you do think that you have superhuman hearing feel free to test yourself with our simple hearing test. There is hope, though: Bluetooth SIG announced LE Audio and the LC3 codec, an efficient alternative to SBC. We\\u2019re excited to see the benefits to the hard-of-hearing community play out in the real world, and know that LC3 will provide a 50% increase in audio quality relative to SBC. What\\u2019s more, headphone stutters will be lessened as packet-loss-management is improved, so instead of hearing annoying, intermittent drops, the dropout process will be much smoother. Even the best headphones will benefit from the new codec. We mentioned codecs in the last section, but what exactly is a Bluetooth codec? If Bluetooth is the technology that enables two devices to communicate with each other, then codecs can be thought of as the language that they speak. When two devices speak the same language, they can communicate faster and send more data between each other which results in better sound quality. Some of the best codecs have high transfer rates if both devices are compatible, and if they aren\\u2019t then everything just reverts down to the basic codec called SBC. Unfortunately, codecs can be a bit finicky and as we mentioned before don\\u2019t always work the way they\\u2019re intended to which is why wired headphones usually sound better. Though it is worth mentioning that Qualcomm\\u2019s aptX adaptive that seems promising, but we\\u2019ll have to wait to test it ourselves before we get our hopes up. If you were wondering how active noise cancellation works, don\\u2019t worry you\\u2019re not alone. There\\u2019s a lot that goes into it and some companies like Bose and Sony have their own ways of achieving it technologically, but it all comes down to basic physics. Active noise cancelling is actually something called destructive interference. If you take one wave with an amplitude of +1 and combine it with another wave that has an amplitude of -1, you\\u2019re left with zero. Active noise cancelling headphones take advantage of this by using tiny microphones to hear what sounds are around you and then creating an opposite sound wave to cancel that before it reaches your ears. Of course, this isn\\u2019t perfect and works better for long, droning sounds then sudden, screeching ones. So don\\u2019t expect ANC headphones to block out that crying baby on your next flight. But when you combine noise cancelling technology with good isolation, you can get pretty close to completely blocking the outside world. This is harder to achieve when it comes to earbuds, as they don\\u2019t completely cover your ear. So instead, a solid pair of memory foam ear tips might be worth looking into as they do a better job at isolating sound than the silicone ones that come with most buds. If you\\u2019d seen this list before, you\\u2019ll probably notice that it\\u2019s completely different than it was in years past. Now it\\u2019s a perpetually updated piece. Gone is the Sennheiser HD 800, and the rest of the exorbitantly expensive headphones. That\\u2019s because we realized that what\\u2019s \\u201cbest\\u201d objectively, isn\\u2019t what\\u2019s \\u201cbest\\u201d for everyone\\u2026 so our selections needed a bit of tweaking. Just like it is with power tools and kitchen utensils, different headphones are built for different purposes. Using the right tool for the job is important, and ensures that you get the best experience possible. You wouldn\\u2019t use a chainsaw to cut butter any more than you\\u2019d use a set of AKG K7XX on an airplane. In that light, we took extra time to take into account how most people actually use headphones. What makes a good pair of gym headphones? What makes a good pair of wireless earbuds? What\\u2019s the good in having a best headphones list that doesn\\u2019t help most people buy headphones they like? While we took the time to highlight some Bluetooth headphones, active noise cancelers, and open-backed cans\\u2014be sure to read the descriptions to see if they\\u2019re right for you. Many people want a set of headphones that will do everything, but those models are few and far between. That\\u2019s why our winner isn\\u2019t a set of headphones you\\u2019d see on other outlets\\u2019 top 10. It\\u2019s more about what people actually want than what\\u2019s objectively the best performing set out there. While many might be upset that we chose more consumer-geared models than the stunning halo products of audiophile lore: it\\u2019s important to us that our readers aren\\u2019t dissatisfied with their headphones. To that end, we find that the ultra-expensive headphones are generally a poor fit for most, often leaving your average consumer frustrated and feeling like they wasted a lot of money. Those with a more developed idea of what kind of headphones they want should also check out our other best lists. Not every best headphone model listed here will meet all of your needs. With that being said, all of our picks were used by at least one team member, and all of these picks sound fantastic. Because our ad-free business model relies on you enjoying your headphones without returning them, this list represents what we earnestly feel is the most deserving of your money. We knew that we wanted to create a list of financially attainable headphones that meet realistic use cases, rather a drool-inducing, unrealistic list for your average consumer. In short, you should trust us because we show our work, strive to provide as much unimpeachable information to you, and pin our revenue model on the happiness of our readers with our recommendations. If you return the product we suggest, we don\\u2019t see a dime. When it comes to audio, the SoundGuys team has years of experience reviewing products between them (and even more listening to them). Chris spent years reviewing audio products, among other things, at publications such as USA Today and Reviewed.com, Lily clocked in countless hours at radio stations and reviewing products independently before joining our team, and Adam has been listening to headphones and speakers for nearly five years as part of SoundGuys. So needless to say, if a product makes best headphones list it\\u2019s because we were genuinely impressed by them and had some hands-on experience with them (or at the very least put in hours of research). I wish I could give you a definitive answer of one perfect pair of\\u00a0wireless headphones, but truthfully, the answer to this question depends on your personal preferences. Do you want really good active noise cancelling? Go for the\\u00a0Apple AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM5. Are you looking for great wireless sound quality and don\\u2019t want to spend a fortune? Check out the Audio-Technica AT-M50xBT2. Is long battery life important to you? Try the Anker Soundcore Space Q45. There are a lot of good headphones out there, and we do our best to outline all the objective facts and describe our subjective experiences with each product so you can make an informed decision based on your personal priorities. The\\u00a0Apple AirPods Max are bound to be a fine pair of headphones for any iPhone user, but the noise cancelling headset is extremely cost-prohibitive. It affords a lot to the right listener, though. Each ear cup houses Apple\\u2019s H1 chip for extensive processing power so the headset can deftly perform tasks like hybrid ANC, passthrough audio, hands-free Siri access, Spatial Audio, and more. If you have multiple Apple devices all synced up to the same iCloud account, you\\u2019ll enjoy automatic device switching. The Sony WH-1000XM4\\u00a0feature several upgrades from the\\u00a0Sony WH-1000XM3 including improved noise cancelling, Bluetooth multipoint, and speak to chat functionality. That being said, the WH-1000XM3 is still an excellent pair of headphones, if outdated compared the even newer, WH-1000XM5.\"}]"
