Toaster oven. Amazing. I recommend [whall]( stainless steel toaster. Doesnt have million of buttons, just 3 functions (for each side), easy to clean does its job perfectly. Also not that expensive.

Hydro flask has great customer service when my screw top lids leaked they sent me three to replace my old ones. Zoj with this version.

Do not put hot beverages in this with the assumption it will cool. It will not. It takes like 10 hours. Put it in like you want to drink it. Middle pops out for cleaning. Lid clicks back so it doesn’t hit your nose. I’ve and water will still have ice 12 hours later. Tried other brands but I’m spoiled now.Zoj mugs don’t go up to 30 ounces.Edit they have 35 ounce vacuum bottle and a different thermos looking one. I can't speak to your specific use case, but I once dropped my Zoji from a (slowly) moving helicopter onto the top of a mountain in Papua New Guinea and I'm actively drinking water out of it bottle as I type this. My yeti rambler is tough as hell. They have a lot of lid and size options, the chug would fit your criteria but i prefer the flip up straw.

She is pretty great otherwise. They're all pretty much the same.
