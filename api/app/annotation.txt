[America's Test Kitchen]( likes the Breville in their latest roundup.Also, most toaster ovens also function similar to an air fryer with it's convection setting.I use mine to toast things all the time (bagels, waffles, bread) as well as cook, reheat and "air fry".

Popular mechanics magazine did a test on water bottles not too long ago and most bottles that are vacuum insulated work the same way and offer insulation of hot/cold for many hours. It‚Äôs more or less personal preference of lids and shape/size that could be deciding factor. One thing I will mention is my yeti gets tossed in the dishwasher daily for the last four years and still looks great. Hydro flasks are not approved for dishwasher fwiw, I tried and the outside got stained and chalky. Hydro flask has great customer service when my screw top lids leaked they sent me three to replace my old ones. Zoj with this version.

Do not put hot beverages in this with the assumption it will cool. It will not. It takes like 10 hours. Put it in like you want to drink it. Middle pops out for cleaning. Lid clicks back so it doesn‚Äôt hit your nose. I‚Äôve and water will still have ice 12 hours later. Tried other brands but I‚Äôm spoiled now.Zoj mugs don‚Äôt go up to 30 ounces.Edit they have 35 ounce vacuum bottle and a different thermos looking one. I can't speak to your specific use case, but I once dropped my Zoji from a (slowly) moving helicopter onto the top of a mountain in Papua New Guinea and I'm actively drinking water out of it bottle as I type this. My yeti rambler is tough as hell. They have a lot of lid and size options, the chug would fit your criteria but i prefer the flip up straw.

She is pretty great otherwise. They're all pretty much the same. Just don't go too cheap (don't want one to die 4 hours into a cook a year from now or to have ridiculous heat) or too expensive (usually just includes features you don't need - like the ability to sear meat in the slow clooker in a much slower and clunkier way than using a simple pan on the stovetop).Just go for a decent mid-tier one by a popular brand (Hamilton Beach, Black and Decker, Crock Pot, etc.) and you'll likely be fine. If you can go inside a store these days, you can see if you like the settings/buttons of one over another. I'd go the route of getting a pressure cooker instead. They work as a slow cooker, rice cooker, and pressure cooker all in one. They are great for quickly cooking beans without needing to soak them first.

Get the Amazon basics scale and call it a day, its dirt cheap, works like a charm and there is nothing else that you will neededit: got a pm asking me on the exact model, not sure i'm allowed to post links to amazon, it's the number 3 item on this list here:  If you do any larger scale baking, a scale with a pull out digital panel is a huge help- the OXO [Good Grip]( 11lb is the most versatile and durable at that price point. Been using one daily in a professional kitchen for years and it has survive the injustices of even the stupidest of my new born baby cooks. I use an Escali Primo. Cheap. Accurate. Easy to read and a range that is functional for my needs. No more. No less. They're all going to be pretty similar, but the one thing I looked for is using AA or AAA batteries.

I love cast iron and use it all the time, but carbon steel is a good option too that‚Äôs still relatively cheap. A lot of the pros of cast iron and a little easier to handle. Lodge cast iron skillet. Cheap and will last a lifetime. I have a cast iron skillet that I got 20 years ago.  I use it every day.On the other hand, I have a cast iron grill that it's a pain in the ass to clean, so I only use it once in a while.However, for versatility, I would suggest you to get a set of stainless steel pots and pans.  Nothing big... maybe just one pan, a medium size pot and a large one.  Even the cheapest brands will last you a lifetime and are way easier to clean than cast iron.Never buy teflon, ceramic, stone or whatever crap they sell in infomercials. Buy stainless steel cookware, or cast iron, or carbon steel. It will last forever. Cast iron and carbon steel can't go in the dishwasher, but stainless steel can and it's worth it. I have All Clad, but I also have some Costco Kirkland pots and pans that were made in Italy and I bought for a few bucks at an estate sale. They work fine and show no signs of wearing out. I also have a special stainless steel sauce pan, it's very small, perfect size for making a hot chocolate or oatmeal and I've had it 30 years. I use and treasure my Allclad Copper Core pans.

Charcoal, gas or pellets: How we tested. >brisket, ribs, pulled porkthese items need to be smoked low and slow, not grilled Sounds like a Weber Kettle charcoal grill is what you want. You can easily do a weeknight grill on it and if you have the time and patience you can learn to smoke on it and if you like it, look into a dedicated smoker down the line.Could also consider a pellet grill but those aren‚Äôt great for weeknight cooks, more geared towards low and slow with very minimal maintenance to the cook required. I'd suggest finding a Weber 22" kettle via Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. Hmm, people say the big green egg is the magic bullet.   You can smoke low and slow or grill super high temps with it.  The cons to it are it‚Äôs very heavy fragile, relatively small and takes a bit of skill to master.  Pellet fed Smokers are like ovens (can‚Äôt sear a steak) but super easy to do ribs on.  For entry level you should probably just get a gas grill or a Weber charcoal grill.  You can smoke with both of those just takes a bit more baby sitting when compared to a good smoker. 1.

Hubby was in Navy too :) Congrats on your surviving :)For beginners, you're really needing to ask yourself a few questions to help guide your answer/decision.How hands on or hands off do you want to be?How great/intense of a smoke flavor do you want?How much space do you have?How much time are you willing to commit to a weekend smoke?For options according to your answers, they are:**Hands On/Off**The most hands off will be a pellet smoker.The most hands on will be any form of offset smokerThe middle is a gravity fed smoker. It's kinda the best of both worlds put together.**Intense flavor**Pellet will produce minimal smoke flavor. Not pot roast in oven zero smoke, and you can have decent results, but it'll always taste like a bit of a smokey pot roast, nothing more.Offsets will produce the most intense smoke flavors you'll ever find. They produce the most smoke, you can control the smoke and heat, and they surround and flow past your meat to assure that the meat is in the most productive contact with smoke available.Gravity feed again merges both. It's almost as hands free as pellet but not quite and it's almost as intense as an offset, but not quite.**Space Requirements**Pellet smokers are really compact. They are pretty small and you can stash them in the corder of any yard or whatever. You can use it even if you have limited/compact spaces.Offset smokers take the biggest footprints seeing they are not only longer and usually deeper and certainly taller than pellet, but you also need to store more wood, which is a hidden "space" that most don't consider when making this decision.Gravity Feed again blends them. They are a bit bigger than pellet, definitely smaller than offsets, and can use more charcoal and lumps of wood instead of split wood (i.e. sticks), so you can have a bag of charcoal and a bag of wood chunks stashed away anywhere.**Time Requirements**This is a misnomer as bbq is bbq and there's no really good way to speed up a 12 pound brisket. What I mean by this is how much time you're willing to sit there and hang out with your smoker and monitor/baby your smoker.Pellet smokers are set and forget. You load up the hopper with pellets or disks, turn on your electric unit or propane tank, and forget it until you're ready to check on it many many hours from now. Want to go to the store and shop? Go to the store and shop. Want to put it on at 10pm and go to sleep and have it still rocking and rolling when you wake up? Then no matter how you answered any of the above questions, you might just want to get a pellet smoker because sleep and time are major factors, and if you have no time to smoke things, then why bother having a smoker?Offset smokers need constant hand holding and monitoring. These are the true "labor of love" type smokers. The ones where you grab yourself a cooler of beer, sit under some shade, and watch it and monitor it so that you can add more wood when needed, make sure smoke is steady, make sure meat is coming along nicely. Again, the produce the best flavor results, but also take the most monitoring to produce those results.Gravity fed are again, kinda the best of both worlds. You have a charcoal hopper on the side. Think "big ass version of a pellet hopper" to which you load up charcoal, then layer in 3-4 chunks of wood, more charcoal, more wood, more charcoal, more wood, and top with charcoal. Then you set it and kinda forget it. It will "feed" itself the charcoal and wood to keep the temperature steady and the smoke steady flowing. It does require a bit of monitoring because they are still brand new technology and only a few places can produce it because of patents (whatever company owns masterbuilt bought out char broiler, so they can use the patent for both. That's why they're so similar outside of cooking chamber design). But it's as close to set and forget as non-pellet can get. And you control the smoke via how much wood hunks (not chips) you add to the layers of charcoal. You can also add more chunks of wood under the fire where the ashes collect to add more smoke if you need it.So there you have it. There are various models of pellet and offset. There are only a few options for gravity fed because of the patents. All those huge rigs you see at competitions or smokehouses are going to be offsets. They can be small or they can be 1,000 gallon chambers. But they are still offsets. I mention that so you don't think that offsets = enormous. They can be smaller but will never be as small/compact as pellet or gravity. Gravity is more of the vertical type but still offset, as are most pellets. Wsm is what you want. Simple enough for a beginner but good enough that you never really need more. You can add digital controllers later on but I would start without. Everyone is going to have a different answer.  I always say go with a cheap electric vertical and buy a pellet tray.  You're not breaking the bank, if it never gets used you're not out much money, you're not having to worry about constantly adjusting it, and you'll get delicious tasting food.  If you enjoy the hobby after a couple seasons you can upgrade and sell the electric second hand or keep it as a back up. Look into gravity fed smokers. Set it and forget it > WSM, better smoke flavor than pellet, the Master built series look like a boss. Get a Masterbuilt Gravity. Pick your size and just enjoy it. You will never regret it 1.

I used a pit boss pro series for 2 years before upgrading to a Camp Chef Woodwind Pro.BTW, here's the [Amazon Link of Pellet Grills Suggested by other Reddit Users]( here. My Traeger turned into an annual repair project, so I wanted something more dependable and replaced it with a Grilla. I originally bought a Z grill because it was highly recommended to me and was cheap. I used it and loved it.I later decided to upgrade and wanted something bugger and higher quality. I learned about the "relationship" between z-grill and Grilla and ended up with a Silverbac. The Grilla Silverbac gave me the quality and size increase I wanted. The quality to price ratio also seemed unparalleled, which was nice. A lot of online research. Google but also use the word ‚Äúforum.‚Äù There are a ton of old school bbq forums with good info, this way you know you‚Äôre not getting some website who is paid to advertise. Traegers are awful bang for your buck, and cheapo pit bosses, etc will start to rust out after a few years. I was looking at rec teq and grilla. Ultimately went with a RT, no complaints, thing works great. I‚Äôm sure that grilla would‚Äôve been the same. If you want to spend more, there‚Äôs always Yoder, mak, pitts and spitts, etc. I personally wouldn‚Äôt go cheaper than RT or grilla though unless you plan on tossing after a few years. 2.

Schick Hydro 5 Sense. Gillette Planet KIND. Merkur Futur. Gillette Mach3. Gillette Heated. Philips Norelco OneBlade. Good old safety razors. I have a hand-me-down Gillette from my grandfather and buy blades online ($0.05 each). I use a double edge safety razor.  You‚Äôll need to experiment to see what you like (aggressive vs not-so-aggressive head, heavy handle vs light handle).  I prefer heavy and aggressive and I go for the Razorock SLAB head with a Muhle R89 handle with feather blades.  I usually shave every day but if I time my shaves right, I can pull off shaving every other day.  I‚Äôve been using the same setup for almost ten years now.  While you‚Äôre getting a nice razor, don‚Äôt forget the prep - nice brush, oil, shave cream, and aftershave.Edit: Also, if you end up going double edge safety route, watch a couple of tutorials before your first shave or you‚Äôll cut yourself up pretty good - not like jugular or anything, just small cuts that are a PITA.  It takes a little finesse but once you get the technique down it‚Äôs easy.  Also, I‚Äôve found the safety razor to be a better quality shave and less irritating to sensitive skin, even when you make a couple passes with it (with grain, across grain, against grain). I love my Merkur safety razor, perfect angle, no nicks or cuts on me in 20+ years of use. Very satisfying shave.    Best razor/shaves I've had.Mine's the 38c, but Pick your favorite, 34c, 38c, 39c etc. in short or long handle. A great blade is required also, I prefer Merkur's platinum stainless double edge blades, but you might want to buy a sampler pack of different brands to discover your blade by feel, and length of usability. And as suggested, visit r/shaving for a journey down the rabbit hole that is shaving. Are you open to a straight razor? or is it newer stuff only? As stated - Dual edge safety razors are great. Stirling soap.com has excellent starter shave kits with less aggressive heads for beginners. Just practice your technique and you‚Äôll be golden. Also, a pro tip I‚Äôve learned. Store your razor head submerged in a cup of mineral oil (~4 at a pharmacy) it will prevent your blade from oxidizing and will prolong its useful life exponentially. Since I‚Äôve started doing this, I use 1 blade (Persona) every 2-3 months shaving 2x a week.

The One Thing I Wish I Had Brought on Vacation. You can extend the life of the razor you like by a billion percent:1.  Get a coffee cup.2.  Get a bottle of [mineral oil]( which is ~$5.3.  Fill coffee cup up to the 2" mark with mineral oil, get a fresh blade on your new razor and drop it, business end first, into the oil.You have just increased the lifespan of ANY razor you use by 7823%.Why and how:  Oxygen corrodes the blade which dulls the blade.  When you store the razor sans oxygen for 99.98% of the day, you remove 99.98% of corrosion.  You remove the razor while lathering and/or kant the blade so it drips into the cup.  Shave as normal.  Clean blade as normal.  Drop into oil.  If you are traveling, one can use an old peanut butter jar with lid instead of a coffee cup.You will use less than 6 razors per year using the above advice.Add mineral oil once a quarter or so as the level naturally drops.  DO NOT use another type of oil or add anything to the oil.  If you use anything other than 100% pure mineral oil, the oil will go to the dark side and smell like a dumpster fire at a Thai restaurant. I have a Merkur brand, I'm not sure the number but looks a lot like the 34C. It's got a short handle and a nice weight. I cannot recommend it enough. I also recommend Feather brand razors. This is what I've been using this combination for about 7 years. Very happy with my set up. I switched over to a safety razor and while there is a little bit of a learning curve, it‚Äôs the best shave I‚Äôve ever had. I bought a Chieftan brand one on Amazon and I‚Äôm sure there are better ones but it‚Äôs stains less steal and gets the job done. If you‚Äôre worried about more sensitive areas, the Leaf razor might be a better choice I‚Äôve heard great things about Leaf. Super in love with my Leaf razor. Uses safety blades that come really cheap, has a more modern tilt head design. It's super heavy weight and solid metal. I don't plan on buying a razor ever again!

I‚Äôve also found that using a little bit of face oil on my dry face before cleansing has done just as well. I use the Trader Joe‚Äôs Vitamin E oil, which is really gentle on my skin, removes my eye makeup, and you really can‚Äôt beat the price. Farmacy clean green balm!!  Green Clean is the GOAT. I double cleanse with this every day and it‚Äôs so gentle for contact wearers. Not sure if it‚Äôs still going on but on their website has $25 off if you spend $50. I really like cleansing oils! I have a tatcha one currently but am planning to get a cheaper one next time as I feel they all are the same. I prefer the oil to everything else I‚Äôve tried. I find it gets my make up off better I like Bioderma (pink cap) micellar water for soaking off my eye makeup with a well-saturated cotton pad. I'll often saturate a cotton bud too and run it along my waterline area to make sure I'm removing every trace of mascara.I've never experienced irritation from it, but then I have never rubbed and scrubbed as some other people do.Most days, Clinique's TTDO is good enough on its own as my first cleanse to remove all my makeup and sunscreen.

They‚Äôre always sold out at Ulta, and it‚Äôs for a reason. Essence Lash princess for only $5 and it‚Äôs about the best mascara I‚Äôve ever used, AND I‚Äôve used a lot of high end mascaras within the lines of Tarte, Benefit, Clinique and Lanc√¥me‚Ä¶ Tubing mascara!  I really love Loreal double extend.  However, I just saw a trick on IG for those who get raccoon eyes -- use whatever mascara you need for volumizing, thickening etc and then apply 1 coat of tubing mascara to lock all that goodness in place. I have yet to try this but I will soon. Maybelline Sky High in waterproof. Seriously the best. I have long lashes without curl, and due to chronic illness I rub my eyes often. The mascara leaves my lashes still just as curled, until 16h later. I've repurchased a few times, and I don't think I'll get another one soon. Roller lash :) it separates my lashes so nicely - my lashes get so stuck together with other ones I swear by l‚ÄôOr√©al Telescopic, it separates the lashes beautifully and really lengthens them, I love it.A bit off topic but lots of people raved about Lanc√¥me‚Äôs Monsieur Big, but I absolutely hate it. It looks very clumpy after just one coat and it just ain‚Äôt it. Has anyone had the same experience with that mascara? AHHH!! It‚Äôs time to talk about MASCARA!!

Related Stories. Aquaphor, but not the lip repair one just the normal aquaphor. it comes in these small little togo squeeze bottles and theyre the only thing that works for me My recipe is thus:1. Use a soft (kids) toothbrush dipped in Vaseline or Aquaphor, gently brush the dead skin cells off your lips. Be careful as you can cause irritation if your brush is too stiff or your brushing is too forceful. You can also use a damp washcloth with a little cream rubbed on for this. (Sugar scrub also works. I've made my own with a little sugar and olive oil. If it makes you happy, just buy the fun yummy ones from Lush or Sephora.) 2. Wipe gently with a damp cloth to remove excess cream and skin. 3. While the lips are still moistened from the damp cloth, apply a hyaluronic serum to your lips. I use the Ordinary brand hyaluronic acid.4. Finish with a layer of Aquaphor or your choice of nourishing occlusive cream. I use a vitamin E oil from Shoppers Drug Mart (Canadian here). I usually do this right after brushing my teeth.Also look into drinking more water if you don't already. If you do drink water and you still have chapped lips, *look into adding electrolytes* to your water. You can still be dehydrated and drink lots of water because what you truly need from the water is to correct the balance of minerals in your body.I buy a hydrating mix from Within Us which has collagen and your essential minerals in stick form, there are plenty on the market, but you can ease into it by trying to add a (low/no sugar) Gatorade to your daily drink repertoire. I got really good advice on Reddit a while back that you need to moisturize your lips then apply an occlusive layer of product like Vaseline or aquaphor to lock the moisture in. That was life changing for my dry ass lips. After I brush my teeth I put a drop of my hyuroic acid serum then a light layer of unscented lotion and top it off with a regular lip balm during the day or a lanolin balm at night. I love palmer‚Äôs cocoa butter stick. I‚Äôve lived in the northeast USA most of my life and cocoa butter was a game changer. It‚Äôs not the lip balm‚Äîspecifically the cocoa butter stick [like this!]( I love the Jack Black ones.

My all time favorite is Mooncat, and I also have a decent amount of Cirque Colors and Cupcake Polish. They all have great formula and a variety of unique special effects polishes. I've been wanting to compare top nail polishes on the same hand at the same time for awhile now. So we purchased the top 10 most popular nail polish brands and nail polish colors on the market. I kept the same base coat and top coat for this 7 day test to see if there would major differences between each nail polish. Let me know if you were surprised with my results.

I have been a fan of CONAIR for many years and have faithfully used their products. I used to own one of Professional Ionic Salon Hair Dryer 1875w . It dries my hair really fast. But then it got burned out. Then I switch to regular target cheap hair dryer which is so loud and takes twice as long to dry my hair. CONFU is a great dryer, gets the job done. There are times that the air that first comes out is cold. I had an old ConAir hairdryer for almost a decade and was crushed when it finally stopped working. then i jump in to JINRI Overall this is a very nice professional quality hair dryer that works quickly A week ago I would have said I loved INFINITI PRO BY CONAIR dryer. However it just stopped working with a poof of smoke and burning smell THE BEST BLOW DRYERS OF 2022! // Hey guys! In This video I share with you my favorite blow dryers of 2022!
