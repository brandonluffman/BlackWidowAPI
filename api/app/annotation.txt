Schick Hydro 5 Sense. Gillette Planet KIND. Merkur Futur. Gillette Mach3. Gillette Heated. Philips Norelco OneBlade. Good old safety razors. I have a hand-me-down Gillette from my grandfather and buy blades online ($0.05 each). I use a double edge safety razor.  You‚Äôll need to experiment to see what you like (aggressive vs not-so-aggressive head, heavy handle vs light handle).  I prefer heavy and aggressive and I go for the Razorock SLAB head with a Muhle R89 handle with feather blades.  I usually shave every day but if I time my shaves right, I can pull off shaving every other day.  I‚Äôve been using the same setup for almost ten years now.  While you‚Äôre getting a nice razor, don‚Äôt forget the prep - nice brush, oil, shave cream, and aftershave.Edit: Also, if you end up going double edge safety route, watch a couple of tutorials before your first shave or you‚Äôll cut yourself up pretty good - not like jugular or anything, just small cuts that are a PITA.  It takes a little finesse but once you get the technique down it‚Äôs easy.  Also, I‚Äôve found the safety razor to be a better quality shave and less irritating to sensitive skin, even when you make a couple passes with it (with grain, across grain, against grain). I love my Merkur safety razor, perfect angle, no nicks or cuts on me in 20+ years of use. Very satisfying shave.    Best razor/shaves I've had.Mine's the 38c, but Pick your favorite, 34c, 38c, 39c etc. in short or long handle. A great blade is required also, I prefer Merkur's platinum stainless double edge blades, but you might want to buy a sampler pack of different brands to discover your blade by feel, and length of usability. And as suggested, visit r/shaving for a journey down the rabbit hole that is shaving. Are you open to a straight razor? or is it newer stuff only? As stated - Dual edge safety razors are great. Stirling soap.com has excellent starter shave kits with less aggressive heads for beginners. Just practice your technique and you‚Äôll be golden. Also, a pro tip I‚Äôve learned. Store your razor head submerged in a cup of mineral oil (~4 at a pharmacy) it will prevent your blade from oxidizing and will prolong its useful life exponentially. Since I‚Äôve started doing this, I use 1 blade (Persona) every 2-3 months shaving 2x a week. In today's VOLT Video, Scott will be discussing the many different types of men's razors and men's shavers on the market, ultimately to answer the age old question: Which men's razor is the best?

The One Thing I Wish I Had Brought on Vacation. You can extend the life of the razor you like by a billion percent:1.  Get a coffee cup.2.  Get a bottle of [mineral oil]( which is ~$5.3.  Fill coffee cup up to the 2" mark with mineral oil, get a fresh blade on your new razor and drop it, business end first, into the oil.You have just increased the lifespan of ANY razor you use by 7823%.Why and how:  Oxygen corrodes the blade which dulls the blade.  When you store the razor sans oxygen for 99.98% of the day, you remove 99.98% of corrosion.  You remove the razor while lathering and/or kant the blade so it drips into the cup.  Shave as normal.  Clean blade as normal.  Drop into oil.  If you are traveling, one can use an old peanut butter jar with lid instead of a coffee cup.You will use less than 6 razors per year using the above advice.Add mineral oil once a quarter or so as the level naturally drops.  DO NOT use another type of oil or add anything to the oil.  If you use anything other than 100% pure mineral oil, the oil will go to the dark side and smell like a dumpster fire at a Thai restaurant. I have a Merkur brand, I'm not sure the number but looks a lot like the 34C. It's got a short handle and a nice weight. I cannot recommend it enough. I also recommend Feather brand razors. This is what I've been using this combination for about 7 years. Very happy with my set up. I switched over to a safety razor and while there is a little bit of a learning curve, it‚Äôs the best shave I‚Äôve ever had. I bought a Chieftan brand one on Amazon and I‚Äôm sure there are better ones but it‚Äôs stains less steal and gets the job done. If you‚Äôre worried about more sensitive areas, the Leaf razor might be a better choice I‚Äôve heard great things about Leaf. Super in love with my Leaf razor. Uses safety blades that come really cheap, has a more modern tilt head design. It's super heavy weight and solid metal. I don't plan on buying a razor ever again!

Greatest Hits. Today‚Äôs Top Clicked. Related Stories. I really like Clinique‚Äôs cleansing balm. It does a great job getting off my makeup without stripping the moisture from my face. I‚Äôve also found that using a little bit of face oil on my dry face before cleansing has done just as well. I use the Trader Joe‚Äôs Vitamin E oil, which is really gentle on my skin, removes my eye makeup, and you really can‚Äôt beat the price. Farmacy clean green balm!!  Green Clean is the GOAT. I double cleanse with this every day and it‚Äôs so gentle for contact wearers. Not sure if it‚Äôs still going on but on their website has $25 off if you spend $50. I really like cleansing oils! I have a tatcha one currently but am planning to get a cheaper one next time as I feel they all are the same. I prefer the oil to everything else I‚Äôve tried. I find it gets my make up off better I like Bioderma (pink cap) micellar water for soaking off my eye makeup with a well-saturated cotton pad. I'll often saturate a cotton bud too and run it along my waterline area to make sure I'm removing every trace of mascara.I've never experienced irritation from it, but then I have never rubbed and scrubbed as some other people do.Most days, Clinique's TTDO is good enough on its own as my first cleanse to remove all my makeup and sunscreen. We put the Face Halo, the Clinique Cleansing Balm, Neutrogena Makeup Remover wipes, and the Urban Decay Makeup Remover Dissolving Spray to the test to see which one removes makeup the best. We used the different makeup removers on the exact same makeup look to see how effective they are at not only removing the makeup but also how they leave the skin after use. All of the makeup removers are critiqued on makeup removal, how easy they are to use, and price. At the end, we reveal which product came out on top as winner and which were big disappointments.. .

It‚Äôs one of few mascaras that does not flake or transfer on my super oily lids, and it also holds a curl (my lashes are also SUPER straight). One coat also provides me with enough length and volume, but I can build it up if I want to. I was actually going to wear false lashes to a wedding last weekend, but my lashes looked so fabulous that I ended up not wearing them. Loreal Telescopic. L'oreal Lash Paradise waterproof is my holy grail, never fail mascara. Maybelline Sky High Waterproof, I swear by it. I also had some Lash Princess, but I prefer the waterproof version over the others and Maybelline is better imo. essence lash princess!!! purple green or coral tubes are my favorite AHHH!!

Related Stories. Aquaphor, but not the lip repair one just the normal aquaphor. it comes in these small little togo squeeze bottles and theyre the only thing that works for me My recipe is thus:1. Use a soft (kids) toothbrush dipped in Vaseline or Aquaphor, gently brush the dead skin cells off your lips. Be careful as you can cause irritation if your brush is too stiff or your brushing is too forceful. You can also use a damp washcloth with a little cream rubbed on for this. (Sugar scrub also works. I've made my own with a little sugar and olive oil. If it makes you happy, just buy the fun yummy ones from Lush or Sephora.) 2. Wipe gently with a damp cloth to remove excess cream and skin. 3. While the lips are still moistened from the damp cloth, apply a hyaluronic serum to your lips. I use the Ordinary brand hyaluronic acid.4. Finish with a layer of Aquaphor or your choice of nourishing occlusive cream. I use a vitamin E oil from Shoppers Drug Mart (Canadian here). I usually do this right after brushing my teeth.Also look into drinking more water if you don't already. If you do drink water and you still have chapped lips, *look into adding electrolytes* to your water. You can still be dehydrated and drink lots of water because what you truly need from the water is to correct the balance of minerals in your body.I buy a hydrating mix from Within Us which has collagen and your essential minerals in stick form, there are plenty on the market, but you can ease into it by trying to add a (low/no sugar) Gatorade to your daily drink repertoire. I got really good advice on Reddit a while back that you need to moisturize your lips then apply an occlusive layer of product like Vaseline or aquaphor to lock the moisture in. That was life changing for my dry ass lips. After I brush my teeth I put a drop of my hyuroic acid serum then a light layer of unscented lotion and top it off with a regular lip balm during the day or a lanolin balm at night. I love palmer‚Äôs cocoa butter stick. I‚Äôve lived in the northeast USA most of my life and cocoa butter was a game changer. It‚Äôs not the lip balm‚Äîspecifically the cocoa butter stick [like this!]( I love the Jack Black ones.

It dries my hair really fast. But then it got burned out. Then I switch to regular target cheap hair dryer which is so loud and takes twice as long to dry my hair. CONFU is a great dryer, gets the job done. There are times that the air that first comes out is cold. I had an old ConAir hairdryer for almost a decade and was crushed when it finally stopped working. then i jump in to JINRI Overall this is a very nice professional quality hair dryer that works quickly A week ago I would have said I loved INFINITI PRO BY CONAIR dryer.

I got the Shu Uemura on a sale and thought it worked well but once that is empty I'll probably go back to the Hada Labo oil cleanser.For chemical exfoliants my holy grail is cosrx's blackhead powder and whitehead powder. Cheap and good just like me :) After researching awhile, I landed on both The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% AHA and COSRX Blackhead Power Liquid BHA. Been using them for about four/five months and my skin is slightly improving. Also helps that they're really cheap! The results I see on r/SkincareAddiction are of a year's worth of usage though so I'm holding on hope! If you want to try a chemical exfoliater, try Krave Beauty‚Äôs Kale Lalu Yaha! Good for beginners who want to try chemical exfoliaters. Works wonders for my skin! It‚Äôs a Korean skincare product made by a YouTube skincare blogger and her skincare line is my faveeee. I'm not a fan of physical exfoliation as I find them too harsh for my skin. Depending on how ~fancy~ I feel, I usually use either: 1. Herbivore Botanicals Blue Tansy - AHA + BHA Resurfacing Clarity Mask (superrr gentle exfoliation, I've never had irritation from using this but also $$$$) 2. COSRX BHA blackhead power liquid (for clearing up dirty pores - cheaper option and still works for me but my skin gets irritated if I use it too often) 3. COSRX AHA whitehead power liquid (for when I want surface glow, or when I have discolouration from pimple scars after healing - cheaper option and still works for me but my skin gets irritated if I use it too often) If you haven't been exfoliating, please don't try all the products together at once! Give your skin some room to get used to it. Maybe like once a week/once every 2 weeks depending on how your skin feels? When I first started exfoliating my skin went crazy because I tried to do once every other day thinking my skin was dirty... it was a hell of a mess to fix as my skin's moisture barrier got compromised. i like Klairs gentle black sugar facial polish! Not sure if they‚Äôre available in physical stores in SG though, but they have an official store on Shopee! Sharing with you the best exfoliators for face and body and how to exfoliate safely. The best drugstore exfoliators 2022.. . Hey guys and welcome back to Mad About Skin where today we are talking about the best exfoliators for face and body and how to exfoliate safely.. . In light of the recent Wayne Goss Exfoliation Hack controversy I wanted to share with you the best exfoliators which will help you to achieve glowing skin, eliminate hyperpigmentation and take breakouts.

Glycerin is used in pretty much every conditioner, and it used to make my hair sosososo frizzy before I figured it out. My absolute holy grail for conditioner is Love Beauty and Planet!! They‚Äôre sold at target for around $10 a bottle and they smell HEAVENLY! This $10 conditioner has worked better for me than any luxury salon brand I‚Äôve ever tried. If you‚Äôre looking for something more high end, try finding one without glycerin and you shouldn‚Äôt be dealing with frizz any longer :)Edit: (I live in Florida so I deal with all kinds of humidity) Seconding the Sally‚Äôs generic conditioning balm! I also use Maui Moisture conditioner for a little more weight and shininess. I have thick, wavy, slightly fine + low porosity hair. Doing the silicone and sulfate free thing keeps my hair as smooth as possible while also maximizing the waves I get. I also find that my hair doesn‚Äôt get ‚Äúused to‚Äù conditioner that is protein free, which is nice. I also have wavy hair. Each strand is medium texture and it‚Äôs high density, low porosity. The Generic Value Products conditioning balm from Sally‚Äôs - it‚Äôs a dupe for Matrix Biolage Hydrasource conditioner. Silicone and protein free (if that matters to you), gives my hair lots of slip and moisture. Smells good too and a great value: seriously the ingredients are almost identical. Davines Love (purple not white) - smells amazing, company has good values IMO which is another bonus. Really extremely thick (it feels like butter) but on the hair, it spreads easily with good slip. Helps a LOT with frizz. Expensive and a little tough to find in the US. Either order online or at a Davines salon but I rarely see it in person at department stores and the brand isn‚Äôt in Ulta or Sephora. Macadamia Processional Ultra Rich Moisture Mask - a hair mask rather than true conditioner but I still use it frequently. It smells amazing to me (kind of a warm cocoa butter fruity smell) and never weighs my hair down or makes it greasy. Great slip in the shower and really detangles. This adds a lot of softness to my crunchy ends lol. Pretty pricey at Ulta but it‚Äôs often at TJ Maxx etc. for about $12 which is a great value for this product. I've always really loved any conditioner from ColorProof! they all smell AMAZING and they all actually work! my hair has thinned out a bit in the last few years so its not as thick, but its still fairly frizzy and curly. my personal favorites to use are the moisturize (purple bottle) or anti frizz (pink bottle). I haven't had the greatest of luck with the baobab one though (green bottle) and I am currently using up the last of my free&clear version of their conditioner (white bottle) and that has worked really well too, but I wouldn't use it on thicker or dryer hair than my own. Very long, thick, coloured hair. I use Olaplex #3 twice a week for 20 minutes.I wash my hair three times a week and rotate Bleach London Reincarnation Mask, Dizziak and Kerastase All Soft Mega (bottle, not tub). My hair is the healthiest it‚Äôs ever been, even with regular heat styling. I haven‚Äôt altered this regime for more than a year. ‚òõ All The Links to Best Conditioner for Women's listed in this Video:-. . 5.Herbal Essences Shampoo and Conditioner Set,.. 4.SoCozy, Curl Spray LeaveIn Conditioner.. 3.Ginger Lily Farms Botanicals Moisturizing Conditioner.. 2.Pureology Hydrate Moisturizing Conditioner.. 1.Redken All Soft Conditioner .. . .

Its a little pricey $100+ but it is compact and does everything. The button setup is a little different but once you get use to it, it rocks.

Popular mechanics magazine did a test on water bottles not too long ago and most bottles that are vacuum insulated work the same way and offer insulation of hot/cold for many hours. It‚Äôs more or less personal preference of lids and shape/size that could be deciding factor. One thing I will mention is my yeti gets tossed in the dishwasher daily for the last four years and still looks great. Hydro flasks are not approved for dishwasher fwiw, I tried and the outside got stained and chalky. Hydro flask has great customer service when my screw top lids leaked they sent me three to replace my old ones. Zoj with this version.

The Instant Pot I got off Amazon is a fantastic slow cooker and also does a bunch of other things well. best kitchen gadget. edit: there is a few models with the same name, the one I am talking about is the number 1 here: [ My wife takes 4 hours to cook a 30 minute recipe. She is pretty great otherwise. They're all pretty much the same. Just don't go too cheap (don't want one to die 4 hours into a cook a year from now or to have ridiculous heat) or too expensive (usually just includes features you don't need - like the ability to sear meat in the slow clooker in a much slower and clunkier way than using a simple pan on the stovetop).Just go for a decent mid-tier one by a popular brand (Hamilton Beach, Black and Decker, Crock Pot, etc.) and you'll likely be fine. If you can go inside a store these days, you can see if you like the settings/buttons of one over another. I'd go the route of getting a pressure cooker instead. They work as a slow cooker, rice cooker, and pressure cooker all in one. They are great for quickly cooking beans without needing to soak them first.

I love cast iron and use it all the time, but carbon steel is a good option too that‚Äôs still relatively cheap. A lot of the pros of cast iron and a little easier to handle. Lodge cast iron skillet. Cheap and will last a lifetime. I have a cast iron skillet that I got 20 years ago.  I use it every day.On the other hand, I have a cast iron grill that it's a pain in the ass to clean, so I only use it once in a while.However, for versatility, I would suggest you to get a set of stainless steel pots and pans.  Nothing big... maybe just one pan, a medium size pot and a large one.  Even the cheapest brands will last you a lifetime and are way easier to clean than cast iron.Never buy teflon, ceramic, stone or whatever crap they sell in infomercials. Buy stainless steel cookware, or cast iron, or carbon steel. It will last forever. Cast iron and carbon steel can't go in the dishwasher, but stainless steel can and it's worth it. I have All Clad, but I also have some Costco Kirkland pots and pans that were made in Italy and I bought for a few bucks at an estate sale. They work fine and show no signs of wearing out. I also have a special stainless steel sauce pan, it's very small, perfect size for making a hot chocolate or oatmeal and I've had it 30 years. I use and treasure my Allclad Copper Core pans.

Charcoal, gas or pellets: How we tested. >brisket, ribs, pulled porkthese items need to be smoked low and slow, not grilled Sounds like a Weber Kettle charcoal grill is what you want. You can easily do a weeknight grill on it and if you have the time and patience you can learn to smoke on it and if you like it, look into a dedicated smoker down the line.Could also consider a pellet grill but those aren‚Äôt great for weeknight cooks, more geared towards low and slow with very minimal maintenance to the cook required. I'd suggest finding a Weber 22" kettle via Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. Hmm, people say the big green egg is the magic bullet.   You can smoke low and slow or grill super high temps with it.  The cons to it are it‚Äôs very heavy fragile, relatively small and takes a bit of skill to master.  Pellet fed Smokers are like ovens (can‚Äôt sear a steak) but super easy to do ribs on.  For entry level you should probably just get a gas grill or a Weber charcoal grill.  You can smoke with both of those just takes a bit more baby sitting when compared to a good smoker. 1.

Hubby was in Navy too :) Congrats on your surviving :)For beginners, you're really needing to ask yourself a few questions to help guide your answer/decision.How hands on or hands off do you want to be?How great/intense of a smoke flavor do you want?How much space do you have?How much time are you willing to commit to a weekend smoke?For options according to your answers, they are:**Hands On/Off**The most hands off will be a pellet smoker.The most hands on will be any form of offset smokerThe middle is a gravity fed smoker. It's kinda the best of both worlds put together.**Intense flavor**Pellet will produce minimal smoke flavor. Not pot roast in oven zero smoke, and you can have decent results, but it'll always taste like a bit of a smokey pot roast, nothing more.Offsets will produce the most intense smoke flavors you'll ever find. They produce the most smoke, you can control the smoke and heat, and they surround and flow past your meat to assure that the meat is in the most productive contact with smoke available.Gravity feed again merges both. It's almost as hands free as pellet but not quite and it's almost as intense as an offset, but not quite.**Space Requirements**Pellet smokers are really compact. They are pretty small and you can stash them in the corder of any yard or whatever. You can use it even if you have limited/compact spaces.Offset smokers take the biggest footprints seeing they are not only longer and usually deeper and certainly taller than pellet, but you also need to store more wood, which is a hidden "space" that most don't consider when making this decision.Gravity Feed again blends them. They are a bit bigger than pellet, definitely smaller than offsets, and can use more charcoal and lumps of wood instead of split wood (i.e. sticks), so you can have a bag of charcoal and a bag of wood chunks stashed away anywhere.**Time Requirements**This is a misnomer as bbq is bbq and there's no really good way to speed up a 12 pound brisket. What I mean by this is how much time you're willing to sit there and hang out with your smoker and monitor/baby your smoker.Pellet smokers are set and forget. You load up the hopper with pellets or disks, turn on your electric unit or propane tank, and forget it until you're ready to check on it many many hours from now. Want to go to the store and shop? Go to the store and shop. Want to put it on at 10pm and go to sleep and have it still rocking and rolling when you wake up? Then no matter how you answered any of the above questions, you might just want to get a pellet smoker because sleep and time are major factors, and if you have no time to smoke things, then why bother having a smoker?Offset smokers need constant hand holding and monitoring. These are the true "labor of love" type smokers. The ones where you grab yourself a cooler of beer, sit under some shade, and watch it and monitor it so that you can add more wood when needed, make sure smoke is steady, make sure meat is coming along nicely. Again, the produce the best flavor results, but also take the most monitoring to produce those results.Gravity fed are again, kinda the best of both worlds. You have a charcoal hopper on the side. Think "big ass version of a pellet hopper" to which you load up charcoal, then layer in 3-4 chunks of wood, more charcoal, more wood, more charcoal, more wood, and top with charcoal. Then you set it and kinda forget it. It will "feed" itself the charcoal and wood to keep the temperature steady and the smoke steady flowing. It does require a bit of monitoring because they are still brand new technology and only a few places can produce it because of patents (whatever company owns masterbuilt bought out char broiler, so they can use the patent for both. That's why they're so similar outside of cooking chamber design). But it's as close to set and forget as non-pellet can get. And you control the smoke via how much wood hunks (not chips) you add to the layers of charcoal. You can also add more chunks of wood under the fire where the ashes collect to add more smoke if you need it.So there you have it. There are various models of pellet and offset. There are only a few options for gravity fed because of the patents. All those huge rigs you see at competitions or smokehouses are going to be offsets. They can be small or they can be 1,000 gallon chambers. But they are still offsets. I mention that so you don't think that offsets = enormous. They can be smaller but will never be as small/compact as pellet or gravity. Gravity is more of the vertical type but still offset, as are most pellets. Wsm is what you want. Simple enough for a beginner but good enough that you never really need more. You can add digital controllers later on but I would start without. Everyone is going to have a different answer.  I always say go with a cheap electric vertical and buy a pellet tray.  You're not breaking the bank, if it never gets used you're not out much money, you're not having to worry about constantly adjusting it, and you'll get delicious tasting food.  If you enjoy the hobby after a couple seasons you can upgrade and sell the electric second hand or keep it as a back up. Look into gravity fed smokers. Set it and forget it > WSM, better smoke flavor than pellet, the Master built series look like a boss. Get a Masterbuilt Gravity. Pick your size and just enjoy it. You will never regret it 1.

My Traeger turned into an annual repair project, so I wanted something more dependable and replaced it with a Grilla. I originally bought a Z grill because it was highly recommended to me and was cheap. I used it and loved it.I later decided to upgrade and wanted something bugger and higher quality. I learned about the "relationship" between z-grill and Grilla and ended up with a Silverbac. The Grilla Silverbac gave me the quality and size increase I wanted. The quality to price ratio also seemed unparalleled, which was nice. Budget range matters.You basically have 3 tiers of quality and price range: sub $750, $1000-$2500(ish), and $3500+.A pit boss is a good quality entry level smoker. I used a pit boss pro series for 2 years before upgrading to a Camp Chef Woodwind Pro.BTW, here's the [Amazon Link of Pellet Grills Suggested by other Reddit Users]( here. A lot of online research. Google but also use the word ‚Äúforum.‚Äù There are a ton of old school bbq forums with good info, this way you know you‚Äôre not getting some website who is paid to advertise. Traegers are awful bang for your buck, and cheapo pit bosses, etc will start to rust out after a few years. I was looking at rec teq and grilla. Ultimately went with a RT, no complaints, thing works great. I‚Äôm sure that grilla would‚Äôve been the same. If you want to spend more, there‚Äôs always Yoder, mak, pitts and spitts, etc. I personally wouldn‚Äôt go cheaper than RT or grilla though unless you plan on tossing after a few years.

I‚Äôm liking wallets from bellroy I discovered Bellroy about 4 years ago and I really like their minimalist approach.  Wallets are very well made IMO. I have had a Bison leather Bifold from Cabela‚Äôs for my last two times. I‚Äôve had my current one for more than 7-8 years and still holding up perfectly. I like the removable ID holder that you can take out and use separately when needed. I see it‚Äôs quite a bit higher cost than it used to be.  $13 wallet from Amazon, has easy access to two most often used cards on outside, otherwise basic black leather bifold, no logo[ I have an LV wallet. They‚Äôre classy and last forever. As physical currency becomes increasingly obsolete, minimalist wallets have quickly replaced the bulky bifolds of yesteryear. After all, when you‚Äôre walking around with just a few cards, there‚Äôs no need to crowd your pockets with a cumbersome everyday carry solution. In this video, we take a look at six of the best minimalist wallets on the market today, being careful to pick an option befitting every EDC enthusiast.. . Purchase Links:. .

Love the two-way stretch cap by Uniqlo, but they are only selling it in this weird paint splatter colorway in the U.S. store. Such a shame. After researching 18 caps and testing 11, I believe the best baseball cap‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt really exist. Most cheap baseball caps will do a fine job of keeping the sun off your face and the rain off your head. If however, you‚Äôre looking for a hat that‚Äôs a cut above‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâsomething a little more grown-up, sophisticated, or sleek‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthen you‚Äôre in the right place.The best baseball cap for sports fans is the **Ebbets Field Flannels Ballcap**. It‚Äôs an authentic, American-made throw-back that stands out on the bleachers. The best minimalist, technical cap is the **Uniqlo Two-Way Stretch Cap**, which is sleek and high-performing at a great price. If you want a stylish, casual cap that doesn‚Äôt bring to mind Steve Buscemi holding a skateboard I recommend either the **Stiksen Canvas 105** or the **Nike ACG AW84**.***# Best cap for sports fans> Ebbets Field Flannels Ballcap [(pic)]( An authentic, American-made, wool baseball cap that pays homage to vintage and defunct teams from around the world. Comes either fitted-to-size or with an adjustable leather closure.> $49/¬£34.50The **Ebbets Field Flannels Ballcaps** are clearly a labour of love for the small Seattle-based company and it shows in the product. Ebbets make everything in-house in a thick wool accurate to the post-war era. They care about authenticity‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthey even provided the uniforms and hats for the Chadwick Boseman movie, 42. You can get hats from Japanese leagues, collegiate teams, the Negro Leagues, and everything in between. I‚Äôm a soccer fan so opted for the ‚Äã‚Äô70s Chicago Cats model as the idea of a cartoon cat kicking a ball on my forehead sparked joy. There‚Äôs plenty of less kawaii options though, take a look through their catalogue.The hats are pretty large with a thick wool material and a flat, broad brim. The wool is quite warm so you‚Äôll probably want to swap to a cotton cap in the summer‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhich Ebbets also make. The headband on the interior is thankfully cotton so you don‚Äôt get the scratchiness of the wool on your forehead.Caps come either fitted to size or with an adjustable leather and metal strap which is pretty sturdy but I‚Äôd still opt for the fitted option; just measure your head before ordering. My cap had a little messiness on the interior stitching but didn‚Äôt interfere with aesthetics or function (and is understandable for a handmade product).If you want a cap that‚Äôs a little more grown-up, stands out at the beer league, or just shows off your knowledge of obscure sports teams, **Ebbets Ballcaps** are a gem.***# Best minimalist cap> Uniqlo Two-Way Stretch Cap [(pic)]( A sleek cap that eschews traditional details like the top button and structured front to create a light, minimalist nylon cap that keeps you dry in a down-pour. Made in China.> $19.90/¬£14.40The **Uniqlo Two-Way Stretch Cap** is a minimalist marvel at half the price of offerings from high-end performance outdoor brands. The cap cleverly reinvents the traditional by updating its materials and construction to remove extraneous details.The metal button at the top of most ballcaps is simply there to hide the join between the fabric but this cap perfectly fits the panels at the crown and has taped seams on the interior to ensure no wind or rain gets through to you. A classic baseball cap uses a buckram or other thick material to hold structure on the two front panels above the forehead but this cap simply removes them making it lighter and more packable.Throughout the hat in the sweatband, peak and panels a single nylon/‚Äãspandex blend is used. The spandex is the source of the ‚Äã‚Äútwo-way stretch‚Äù moniker allowing the cap to conform around your head for a good fit no matter the width of your dome. A lot of the unstructured nylon and polyester caps tested left unsightly dimpling at the top of the crown but the slight spandex blend minimized this issue. The closure is a simple black plastic buckle but the nylon strap has a small amount of reflective thread sewn into it. Its pretty small but will help you stand out to cars or bikes behind you at night.The exterior has a DWR (Durable Water Repellant) coating to bead up rain and keep you dry. This will fade over time with wear though so you may have to retreat it yourself after a year or two. It comes in either navy or black but I prefer the navy colourway as it wears dust better and has a slightly richer tone.The **Uniqlo Two-Way Stretch Cap** is a modern, sleek hat that‚Äôll appeal to minimalists, all-black wearers and techwear enthusiasts and it can be had at a very reasonable price point.***# Also good> Stiksen Canvas 105 [(pic)]( An unstructured, low-profile, organic cotton cap to add a little colour and texture to an outfit. Comes in 3 sizes with an adjustable cotton and metal strapback. Made in Bangladesh.> $49/¬£39Stiksen only makes caps and that focus pays dividends in the **Stiksen Canvas 105 cap**. The Canvas 105 is a classic 6‚Äëpanel cap but adds an x‚Äëfactor with its low-profile, unstructured panels, and textured canvas that add texture, colour and a laid-back vibe to an outfit. Unlike most one-size-fits-most offerings, Stiksen have three unisex sizes and an adjustable closure in a matching canvas strapback and metal buckle. Branding is pretty minimal with a small rubber circle stamp at the back left of the exterior, though I would still rather branding was restricted to the interior.The cap is manufactured in Bangladesh, a country with well documented and widely publicised issues around labour practices in the fashion industry. As a result we were somewhat skeptical. However, upon further inspection Stiksen‚Äôs fabric is produced [by a non-profit employing rural women]( and is GOTS ([Global Organic Textile Standard]( certified. GOTS is a great standard to look for as it guarantees both the fabric as organic but also that the workers receive at least a minimum of fair labor practices.Swedish direct-to-consumer brands have a good track record here on Typical Contents and Stiksen are no exception. The unstructured, slubby material of the **Stiksen Canvas 105** is a great way to give an outfit a more casual vibe or add a pop of colour and texture.***# Also good> Nike ACG AW84 Cap [(pic)]( A cap full of 80s hiking goodness that breaks all conventions with a short brim, baffled top, ripstop fabric and a toggle closure. Made in Vietnam.> $35/¬£30Nike‚Äôs ACG line has produced a [GORPcore]( classic with the **NIKE ACG AW84 Cap**. From the ubiquitous sea of cotton 6‚Äëpanel caps this cap stands out a mile with four (four!) features I hadn‚Äôt seen on any other baseball hat.The first and most prominent is its baffled top which evokes puffer jackets and sleeping bags more than hats. It‚Äôs made of a rip-stop polyester so will wear and tumble well. The closure gives camping vibes with a plastic cord lock and finally, my favourite feature, the underside of the brim is depressed inwards about an inch from the edge which is just the exact point at which you grip the cap with your thumb to take it on or off. This brim detail is a simple, quality of life feature but truly made this hat more pleasant to wear than any others on this list.Achingly, the only thing holding the AW84 back is that it‚Äôs not waterproof. If Nike had added a DWR to the exterior this would‚Äôve been an out of the park home run. My head is on the larger side at about 27 1‚ÅÑ2 inches and I‚Äôm just at the limit of this one-size hat so if you‚Äôve got a bigger noggin I‚Äôd look to other options.Despite it‚Äôs lack of waterproofing, Nike‚Äôs ACG AW84 Cap was a personal favourite of those tested and will be a welcome companion on hikes, BBQs and camping trips. If you haven‚Äôt tried hats from Melin your really missing out. Not cheap but premium materials and excellent quality. Have a few that are 2-3 years old and still look brand new. They wash and don‚Äôt shrivel or shrink. They don‚Äôt fade. Moisture wicking headbands. And they float!!!  It‚Äôs tough to swallow the price, about $60 bucks, I know, but once you wear one you‚Äôll understand. Haven‚Äôt bought another brand of hat in 3 years and can‚Äôt see that changing anytime soon. That should say something Really enjoyed this thanks for taking the time to create this.

I always have a hat ready to go! [This]( is my current go to hat when I know I will be outdoors in a casual setting. It is surprisingly flattering and has a large brim. I have a variation of [this]( hat that is more on the stylish side but I honestly haven't been wearing it since I got my nordstrom one. I think the hat's I linked can be worn for a variety of occasions. Although I live in Southern California so the weather is always sunny and we always dress casually. So I think hats fit the lifestyle down here easily. [These]( are some casual outfits that I would wear with hats. My style is veeeery basic but my goal is to look put together and I think I achieve that. [Here]( is an imgur inspo album from some images I have saved on pinterest. (Sorry this isn't an official album with sources and a variety of body types and etc.)I'm not up with the hat trends but I think they are coming into style more because a few years ago is was hard to find cute wide brimmed hats that didn't scream "beach!" I think that most people can look good in hats (even when they swear they don't) if they go through the effort of trying different styles on. I find hats that have a point in the front (I don't know words) like [this]( are very flattering on me. Whereas rounded or squared hats (again words) like [this]( make me look weird and frumpy. Although [my current go to hat]( has a rounded top, but the angle of the brim is very flattering. So I think the angle and length of brim plays a role in how good a hat looks as well. For travel I bought this [hat clip]( and it has saved me. It is expensive but I say it's worth the money and I would recommend it 100%. Some hats on my wishlist are a [black felt hat]( that I could wear in fall and winter. A [visor]( so I can wear my hair up. And a [hat in a fun color]( Thank you for listening to my TED Talk. Next week I will be discussing the importance of wearing SPF Daily.Edit. Also, I felt really out of place when I first started wearing hats normally. But it is so much more comfortable to be outside on a sunny day when wearing a hat. I also have a had people comment that they were jealous of my hat on a warm day. People get used to seeing you in a hat and it becomes more normal feeling. [This]( is my everything hat for the summer.  I've worn it with tea dresses for garden parties and with flared jeans and a fitted tshirt. Thank you for this! I have such hat envy when I see girls out and about with their straw hats in the summer. I have a HUGE head and hats feel like they trap heat for me. Any advice on where to find summer hats for huge noggins? Baseball hats are too hot and trucker hats never stay on my head - too slippery. YESSSSS HATS! Bring back hats! I love summer hats and winter hats. Fuck I love hats. They keep you so cool and protect you so much, and they‚Äôre cute as heck. For summer, I wear a paper straw hat I got on Amazon with as adjustable chin strap. I wish more hats had these tbh, here in Chicago one strong breeze will blow your hat right off. I also have a collection of varying summery floppy hats from TJMaxx. [link]( I LOVE summer hats. I wear a big floppy straw sunhat all summer but also a canvas one for travel; collapsible visor for super hot days; baseball cap for physical activities. I‚Äôve been seeing soooo many different neat hats and visors  on women in the city! They all look great and it‚Äôs so exciting that women are prioritizing their comfort and safety and looking so good doing it! I don‚Äôt think there is a faux pas equivalent to the trilby. I don‚Äôt like bucket hats, but I‚Äôm happy for the people who do! üåµ8 Best Hats For Women 2021.

Going against the stream and *not* give you brand ideas but instead share the wisdom I gained from asking the older women in my life with extensive and absolutely stunning and unique/uncommon jewelry collection how they managed to establish that collection.Most of them don't shop online, but each of them said; I know my style and my aesthetic. Whenever I'm in a new place I take a quick moment to look through the window of jewelry stores I come across to see if they have something that fits that style and aesthetic. If they do, they take a better look inside and they often end up buying a piece on the spot. It's maybe max a handful of pieces a year they gather this way, but over the years it adds up.How I translate this to the internet age; know how your kind of aesthetic is *called* so you know what words to look for online. In my case, my collection is practically 100% modernist in style, with a specific love for brutalist jewelry (a sub stream of modernism). I can use those words to search through etsy once every month or two. That's how I came across a one shot Etsy shop that was selling a one off collection of original brutalist vintage jewelry in absolutely mint condition. I bought 3 pieces straight away after finding that shop.On top of that, I do check out every physical (vintage) shop I come across real quick like those older women I know.Edit for a bonus tip; pay special attention/specifically ask about local designers! Shops that carry local designer stuff are always the best shops to carefully look through and the locally designed stuff will most likely be of amazing quality and have unique designs. just putting it out there, I had a nightmare experience with Jennifer Fisher jewelry and do not recommend you waste your time and moneylowkey scared she's going to find this in a google search and harass me based off an instagram message chain we had We had an excellent [megathread on jewelry brands]( a year or so ago with tons of great recommendations. For my cartilage piercings, I am deathly afraid of infection so I just went to a piercing/tattoo shop and got a small gold ring to keep in my cartilage piercing forever! It's so dainty and completely made of gold, not gold plated. They also inserted the ring for me, which was a plus. It was more expensive than just buying my own piece and inserting it myself, but I will never ever change it, so I think it was completely worth it!

Could help with choosing between chains. I like the franco chain best out of the two. My husband's father gifted him his crucifix on his death bed. It was on a figaro but too short for my husband. I tried a diamond cut rope chain first - & it broke. Next I purchased a curb/cuban chain & 3 years later it's still going strong. Also - it's only removed for showers (can't convince him not to sleep in it!) :) A rope chain is always a good choice for a pendant or charms. I would go with either a rope, Franco, wheat, or a Miami Cuban that has tight links. Rope is going to be the most affordable, Franco the most expensive. Here's my [rope chain]( get more size for your money with a rope chain. Francos and slightly less so Miamis are very dense for their size and also more durable at smaller sizes Make sure whatever chain you get is actual gold, otherwise it will turn and look different against the cross! r/mensjewelry Top 10 list popular gold chain in the world for mens.

 I made most of my earrings. Small samples:[Yves Tanguy painting earrings originally gifted to Peggy Guggenheim]( (original left, my replica on right)[Two Art Deco earrings]( of mid-19th century malachite dangle earrings]( Pocky, Chicken & Waffle, Cheese, Bok Choy, and Waterbotyle earrings]( I have very tiny, ‚Äúattached‚Äù earlobes that I inherited from my mother. She had to stop wearing any heavy earrings when I was growing up due to the earlobe situation, and passed on so many beautiful pairs to me.  Now I‚Äôm almost 30 and am running into the same problem and I‚Äôm completely devastated. My dearly loved dangly pairs bother me after only a couple of hours. I used to collect earrings like no one's business (I worked in jewelry for four years so it was sort of an unavoidable side effect, haha). However, as my collection of piercings began to grow I started to focus more on upgrading my piercing jewelry and curating a cohesive collection that would last me a while. [BVLA]( makes some of my absolute favorite ends and I'm also lusting after some stunning pieces from [Sacred Symbols]( for future upgrades.Over the summer I finally caved and got some gold mejuri huggie hoops (I 100% blame Instagram ads) for my first lobe piercings and haven't really taken them off since! They just work so well with everything else that I have right now. At this point my second lobe piercings are the only ones that I change out with any regularity, but I keep them pretty minimal. I don't have any great recent photos of my left ear, but [this is my current set up]( on my right ear (the dagger is my newest addition), and I'm so happy with it! I'm wearing [these opal huggies.]( They're super cute, comfy and handmade. I have my eyes on [these](  right now. This is a local artist that I am obsessed with. I have two necklaces from her that I love and am about to get on the earring train.

Don't be a sucker and spend a lot of money on real diamonds. Go for cubic zirconia or something similar.  I wear a pair from walmart and I get compliments on them all the time.Don't be a moron and get gauges unless you're comfortable with potentially needing surgery to fix your ears down the line.  When I go to professional environment's I can simply take out my earrings and no one would know.## Chunky gold hoops. Start with a very small stud type. Doesn't have to be a shiny diamond-like or other sparkley thing. They have plain silver little ones. Like a little silver disc or ball.  The reason I suggest these is they are low key and inexpensive.  If you decide you want more, not a big deal to change them once your love heals. Earrings are very inexpensive unless going for real diamonds and such. I wear them pretty much everywhere except for work - I'd recommend just regular studs to start with. I have ones with a clear stone and gold accent, because all the other jewelry I wear is gold as well. As long as your metals match it's not a big deal.Once you get past the first month or 2 and you can actually change them, you can branch out if you want. Most of the time I still just wear my normal studs, but I also have some Playboy bunny ones that I occasionally wear as a joke. Currently wearing flat black circular studs. They are cheap on Amazon, come in various sizes, and the shape keeps them from snagging on most things, like pillows, headphone cushions, etc.Plus they look nice and go with almost anything. As a dude who swaps from urban, fuccboi, and alternative, styles their versatility is great.

Bleue Burnham. Maria Black. LEF Jewelry. Tilly Sveaas. Appreciate the effort and content. Been looking into rings lately too. You didn't mention The Great Frog which I think has some unique rings. Those gucci rings are so cool. Wish they were actual gold tho.  I bought a ring pack from ASOS on sale and I've had no green finger and get lots of compliments  Maybe add *Chrome Hearts* to the expensive list? They're somewhat well-known while still being  exclusive, difficult to acquire and very costly. Something that people on this sub seem to like.Edit: Also goes pretty nicely with the SLP aesthetic that r/streetwear likes Nothing found

Related Pages. Not sure if it‚Äôs the best, but I own a Ninja and like it. Easy to clean up and operate. The Ninja! got it a while back after reading a recommendation on a similar post and it's amazing piece of tech edit: there are a few models, here is the link i bought it from [ (it's on the number 1 in this list) I have owned 3 different air fryers and I will share my thoughts on them.  I am a single dad with a 16 year old son who lives with me.  I cook at home 95% of the time, and I value ease of use and convenience for cooking during the week.  I eat a relatively clean diet with as little processed foods as possible.  My son plays sports and I workout 4 days a week.  We consume a lot of food.  Realistically, the amount of food he and I eat would support a family of 4.  I say that so you understand the strain I put on these machines.Power XL (10qt I think): This was the first air fryer I bought.  I got it at Sam's Club.  This thing got put through the ringer.  It had the functions to dehydrate and all that, but I never used it that way.  Every night it was loaded up with proteins and vegetables.  It did a great job of cooking everything from chicken wings to pork loin to salmon.  Things cooked quickly and you always ended up with a nice crust (if that is what you were aiming for).  Was excellent for cooking wings.  The limitation it had was size.  As stated above, we eat a lot of food.  These machines rely on airflow to do what they do.  When you overload them, you are sacrificing the quality of your results.  I also used it to roast vegetables in.  Worked fantastic for that as well.  My son would cook frozen french fries and stuff in it and they seemed to always come out great.  Very good for heating up food too.  Clean up was not too bad.  I would run the racks through the dishwasher.  I would cover the drip tray in aluminum foil to make clean up easier as well.  I used a damp microfiber towel to wipe down the interior.  After about 10 months, I blew the thermal overload fuse.  Honestly, I got my money's worth out of it.  It was a great machine.  Just a little small for my purposes.Emeril Lagasse Power Airfryer 360:  Bought this one at Costco after I killed the other one.  Since you already know what and how I tend to cook in an air fryer,  I will just give you my thoughts on this one.  It was bigger which seems like a plus.  It just didn't perform the same as the power xl.  I think the larger size effected the performance (I didn't really realize this until later).  Wings didn't get as crispy.  The crust on a pork chop just wasn't the same.  It had a nice user interface that was simple to use.  Clean up was about the same.  The biggest issue was that the digital screen went out after about 2 months.  I took it up to Costco and they gave me a refund for it.  They didn't have any more in stock, so I decided to do some research and go another route for a replacement.Instant Pot Omni Plus:  I ordered this one on amazon after reading a lot of reviews.  This one is actually bigger than the Emeril.  Great user interface.  Simple of setup type of cooking and timer.  Had a lot of great functions.  Was more than big enough to roast a whole chicken using the rotisserie.  Once again though, size meant sacrificing airfryer quality.  This thing is more akin to an oven than an airfryer.  It would produce better chicken wings than a full size convection oven, but not dramatically better.  The biggest issue I had was the smoke.  Wow, did this thing smoke!  No matter how well I cleaned it, it would smoke up the kitchen like mad.  I ended up using it on the back patio because of it.  Moving it in and out of the house nearly everyday became too much, and I found myself just using my convection oven instead.  So after about 6 months it ended up going bye bye.For now, I am just using the convection oven.  I might venture back into the airfryer market at some point.  We will see.  My general takeaways are that an airfryer works because you can concentrate lot of heat and airflow in a compact space.  That gives you the results you would expect from a good airfryer.  When you go up in size, you lose that effect due to the limitations of the power output the larger machines have in relation to their size.  If you are cooking a reasonable amount of food for 1 or 2 people, you can buy a 10-12 quart machine and get great results.  Honestly, I wouldn't go overboard buying one with all the bells and whistles.  That is just me though.  I am not proofing bread dough or dehydrating foods, so I don't need all of that.  If you do, you might want a machine that will do all of those things.  For my purposes, a simple to use user interface combined with a high output heating element and a good fan is all I would want.  Maybe some other people's reviews on here will help me decide if I want to buy another one or not.  Anyways, just thought I would share my thoughts and experience. There is no such thing as an air fryer that actually fries food.They are basically tiny convection ovens with extra fans.They are great for reheating things and baking breaded items but they won't work with battered things the same way an actual fryer would. The New York Times Wirecutter team just re-iterated their (correct) stance on air fryers and list their recommendations: you are paywalled out , they recommend this Cuisinart: for most uses unless you are really short on space in which case they recommend this pod shaped (lower capacity) device: We tested the Instant Vortex Air Fryer, the Ninja Foodi DualZone Air Fryer and the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer to help YOU pick the right one! . .

Further reading. Wirecutter‚Äôs 100 Most Popular Picks in November 2022. Humidifiers Get Gross Fast. Here‚Äôs How to Clean Them. I don't have a specific brand, instead I recommend a type: evaporative humidifiers.tldr: cheap and easy to run with minimal maintenanceI've been through multiple ultrasonic humidifiers that work fine but maintenance is a nightmare.  Even with distilled water it turns into a petri dish within a week for me. I ended up using bleach to clean it and it would usually last two weeks.  It was disgusting.  Everything that is in the water gets atomized and sent into the air.The evaporative unit I got last winter didn't require any cleaning all winter long.  I used the recommended anti-microbial with each tank of water refill and never had an issue.  I used two wicks throughout the winter but it was unnecessary to seal when I did.Any humidifier with a tank is going to require refilling as needed.  The convenience of tap water + anti-microbial easily beats buying or making distilled water in both effort and cost.  The ultrasonic humidifiers need a fair amount of power to run non-stop.  Evaporative humidifiers just run a fan and maybe a humidity meter, making them cheaper.I recommend an evaporative unit that's designed for the size of your home/apartment (rate of water evaporation) and meets your refilling schedule (water tank size).  Beyond that there is no extra technology that goes into them, get one that looks nice or can fit somewhere out of the way. top fill is the way to go, regardless of brand. I won't even look at a humidifier that requires me to remove the tank and flip it over to fill. All 5 currently in use in our house (also have radiators) are top fill, so just fill up a pitcher and pour in as needed. Clean once a week with white vinegar and good to go. Check out Venta. They are German made and pricey, but all parts are replaceable so it should last way longer than most.  We have the comfort plus 45 and it can maintain our 2200 sqft house. Friendly reminder that ALL Cold-mist/Ultrasonic MUST use distilled water. They can turn tap water particles (minerals, metals, pollutants) into tiny potential carcinogens if you're inhaling them on a daily/nightly basis. Ultrasonic humidifiers are filthy and eventually crap our. I average 3-4 years out of them. Best to buy one that integrates with your furnace and I would not recommend the evaporative ones that blow air against a water panel (most Honeywell are like this.) I‚Äôm talking about one with a small boiler than injects steam into the ducts when the furnace is running.   The one I have is Aprilaire brand in the US.

How to Prep Your Bedroom for Winter. 5 Cheap(ish) Things to Keep Your Bedroom Cool. Hosting Overnight Guests in Your Small Space. Here's my knowledge from a few years as a sales associate working partially in the linens department, as well as a few other departments.Here are a few things you should be on the lookout for when considering a comforter/duvet:* Baffle Box construction - You definitely want this. This means that there is stitching going both length-wise and width-wise on the comforter (both vertical and horizontal lines). The reason you want this is so that all of the filling does not go to one side, you will have a even distribution of the filling (poly or feather/down)* High Thread Count - You are going to probably want at least 400. 250 is the lower end, 600+ is the higher end. Thread count means how many threads there are per square inch on your comforter. The reason you want at least a medium count is because the lower your thread count, the more likely you are going to get the filling leaking out. This is ESPECIALLY important for down, once you get a few feathers out, there will always be more on the way.* The difference between White Goose down and White Duck down. White Goose down is superior because Goose Down does NOT have quills, while Duck down does. Quills are an issue because there are both uncomfortable (spiky and pokey!) and they are more likely to poke holes in your comforter/duvet. Products that say something like "White Down Duvet" or "White Feather Duvet" and do not EXPLICITLY state "GOOSE" are most likely Duck, or at the very best a mix of Goose and Duck.That's all I can really think of right now, best of luck! I switched from comforter to a korean mink blanket about ten years ago and never regretted it.  The only problem is if you have cats, it will attract fur like crazy. Try layering with sheets, thick wool blankets, and a quilt on top.  I have a think wool blanket made in mexico that is about a third of an inch thick, and will keep you warm in almost any weather.  Add a quilt on top for winter, which should last a really long time if you treat it right, and high thread count sheets underneath which are amazingly comfortable and will last a long time, though not forever, if you treat them right. I dunno about comforters, but Hudson Bay Point Blankets. A lot of the ones made in the 1800s are still in great condition, and the manufacturing is still the same. A few years ago I was in Iceland, and they are very big on Eider Down comforters there (up until they started exporting funny financial instruments, it was one of their big exports aside from sea products).  They are _phenomenally_ expensive ‚Äî you can only take a small amount of down from the Eider duck's nest each season ‚Äî but apparently some of the warmest insulation around.  Because of the extreme expense, some people I talked to had ones that were generations old.  To keep them from getting worn, they're used like duvets inside a cover, and only the cover gets washed (I think).Anyway, if you ever want to buy the best of the best, I think that's the thing. ‚¨áÔ∏è Click the coupon links below to get the best prices on these comforters! ‚¨áÔ∏è. . ‚úÖ Buffy -. ‚úÖ Brooklinen -. ‚úÖ Egyptian Bedding -. ‚úÖ Superior -. ‚úÖ Chezmoi -.
