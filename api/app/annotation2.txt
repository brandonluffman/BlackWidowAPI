Vitamix.  Get refurbished and save money Once you go Vitamix you never go back! Vitamin. I‚Äôve had mine 12 years and used 3-5x a week every week since then. It‚Äôs a workhouse and amazing. Just a tip if your trying to gain to weight, you should drink these before bed! I used this same product and would use it post workout and the problem was it would fill me up for the rest of the day and I wouldn‚Äôt eat any real food. If you want to really bulk up you should still eat the same amount and ADD this to your diet not replace something else. I like the ninja

Toaster oven. Amazing. I recommend [whall]( stainless steel toaster. Doesnt have million of buttons, just 3 functions (for each side), easy to clean does its job perfectly. Also not that expensive. Consider a toaster oven. Yeah, those waffles lay flat instead of vertical but my Cuisinart is going on 12+years now and doing amazing. [America's Test Kitchen]( likes the Breville in their latest roundup.Also, most toaster ovens also function similar to an air fryer with it's convection setting.I use mine to toast things all the time (bagels, waffles, bread) as well as cook, reheat and "air fry".  You'd have to pry my toaster oven from my toasted dead hands.  I haven't had a traditional toaster for 30+ years.If you really want a somewhat traditional toaster, here's what [America's Test Kitchen says about larger format toasters]( I find the Panasonic FlashXpress to be the best toaster I've ever had. Its a little pricey $100+ but it is compact and does everything. The button setup is a little different but once you get use to it, it rocks. It doesn't take up a lot of space either and is highly rated.

Popular mechanics magazine did a test on water bottles not too long ago and most bottles that are vacuum insulated work the same way and offer insulation of hot/cold for many hours. It‚Äôs more or less personal preference of lids and shape/size that could be deciding factor. One thing I will mention is my yeti gets tossed in the dishwasher daily for the last four years and still looks great. Hydro flasks are not approved for dishwasher fwiw, I tried and the outside got stained and chalky. Hydro flask has great customer service when my screw top lids leaked they sent me three to replace my old ones. Zoj with this version. Zojirushi SM-SA36-BA Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Mug, 20-Ounce, Blackby Tokyo Japanese OutletLearn more:  newer with a different top don‚Äôt flip up right. I‚Äôve had mine for years. Warning! Do not put hot beverages in this with the assumption it will cool. It will not. It takes like 10 hours. Put it in like you want to drink it. Middle pops out for cleaning. Lid clicks back so it doesn‚Äôt hit your nose. I‚Äôve and water will still have ice 12 hours later. Tried other brands but I‚Äôm spoiled now.Zoj mugs don‚Äôt go up to 30 ounces.Edit they have 35 ounce vacuum bottle and a different thermos looking one. I can't speak to your specific use case, but I once dropped my Zoji from a (slowly) moving helicopter onto the top of a mountain in Papua New Guinea and I'm actively drinking water out of it bottle as I type this. My yeti rambler is tough as hell. They have a lot of lid and size options, the chug would fit your criteria but i prefer the flip up straw. I left my 26oz in a hot car for 14 hours, and the water was still ice cold. I‚Äôm just looking for any bottle not made in China

The Instant Pot I got off Amazon is a fantastic slow cooker and also does a bunch of other things well. best kitchen gadget. edit: there is a few models with the same name, the one I am talking about is the number 1 here: [ My wife takes 4 hours to cook a 30 minute recipe. She is pretty great otherwise. They're all pretty much the same. Just don't go too cheap (don't want one to die 4 hours into a cook a year from now or to have ridiculous heat) or too expensive (usually just includes features you don't need - like the ability to sear meat in the slow clooker in a much slower and clunkier way than using a simple pan on the stovetop).Just go for a decent mid-tier one by a popular brand (Hamilton Beach, Black and Decker, Crock Pot, etc.) and you'll likely be fine. If you can go inside a store these days, you can see if you like the settings/buttons of one over another. I'd go the route of getting a pressure cooker instead. They work as a slow cooker, rice cooker, and pressure cooker all in one. They are great for quickly cooking beans without needing to soak them first. My instant pot even has a yogurt setting

Get the Amazon basics scale and call it a day, its dirt cheap, works like a charm and there is nothing else that you will neededit: got a pm asking me on the exact model, not sure i'm allowed to post links to amazon, it's the number 3 item on this list here:  If you do any larger scale baking, a scale with a pull out digital panel is a huge help- the OXO [Good Grip]( 11lb is the most versatile and durable at that price point. Been using one daily in a professional kitchen for years and it has survive the injustices of even the stupidest of my new born baby cooks. I use an Escali Primo. Cheap. Accurate. Easy to read and a range that is functional for my needs. No more. No less. They're all going to be pretty similar, but the one thing I looked for is using AA or AAA batteries. Easy to get rechargeables and if the battery goes dead, you can steal some from the remote instead of trying to find a 2032 (or whatever coin cell). Looking at mine I don't even see a brand, but it is model ek9333. I have a rechargeable (usb) Zwilling scale. I love it!

I‚Äôll comment just to add some diversity. I love cast iron and use it all the time, but carbon steel is a good option too that‚Äôs still relatively cheap. A lot of the pros of cast iron and a little easier to handle. Lodge cast iron skillet. Cheap and will last a lifetime. I have a cast iron skillet that I got 20 years ago.  I use it every day.On the other hand, I have a cast iron grill that it's a pain in the ass to clean, so I only use it once in a while.However, for versatility, I would suggest you to get a set of stainless steel pots and pans.  Nothing big... maybe just one pan, a medium size pot and a large one.  Even the cheapest brands will last you a lifetime and are way easier to clean than cast iron.Never buy teflon, ceramic, stone or whatever crap they sell in infomercials. Buy stainless steel cookware, or cast iron, or carbon steel. It will last forever. Cast iron and carbon steel can't go in the dishwasher, but stainless steel can and it's worth it. I have All Clad, but I also have some Costco Kirkland pots and pans that were made in Italy and I bought for a few bucks at an estate sale. They work fine and show no signs of wearing out. I also have a special stainless steel sauce pan, it's very small, perfect size for making a hot chocolate or oatmeal and I've had it 30 years. I use and treasure my Allclad Copper Core pans. Also use Fontignac enamelled cast iron (made in France)

>brisket, ribs, pulled porkthese items need to be smoked low and slow, not grilled Sounds like a Weber Kettle charcoal grill is what you want. You can easily do a weeknight grill on it and if you have the time and patience you can learn to smoke on it and if you like it, look into a dedicated smoker down the line.Could also consider a pellet grill but those aren‚Äôt great for weeknight cooks, more geared towards low and slow with very minimal maintenance to the cook required. I'd suggest finding a Weber 22" kettle via Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. Hmm, people say the big green egg is the magic bullet.   You can smoke low and slow or grill super high temps with it.  The cons to it are it‚Äôs very heavy fragile, relatively small and takes a bit of skill to master.  Pellet fed Smokers are like ovens (can‚Äôt sear a steak) but super easy to do ribs on.  For entry level you should probably just get a gas grill or a Weber charcoal grill.  You can smoke with both of those just takes a bit more baby sitting when compared to a good smoker.

Hubby was in Navy too :) Congrats on your surviving :)For beginners, you're really needing to ask yourself a few questions to help guide your answer/decision.How hands on or hands off do you want to be?How great/intense of a smoke flavor do you want?How much space do you have?How much time are you willing to commit to a weekend smoke?For options according to your answers, they are:**Hands On/Off**The most hands off will be a pellet smoker.The most hands on will be any form of offset smokerThe middle is a gravity fed smoker. It's kinda the best of both worlds put together.**Intense flavor**Pellet will produce minimal smoke flavor. Not pot roast in oven zero smoke, and you can have decent results, but it'll always taste like a bit of a smokey pot roast, nothing more.Offsets will produce the most intense smoke flavors you'll ever find. They produce the most smoke, you can control the smoke and heat, and they surround and flow past your meat to assure that the meat is in the most productive contact with smoke available.Gravity feed again merges both. It's almost as hands free as pellet but not quite and it's almost as intense as an offset, but not quite.**Space Requirements**Pellet smokers are really compact. They are pretty small and you can stash them in the corder of any yard or whatever. You can use it even if you have limited/compact spaces.Offset smokers take the biggest footprints seeing they are not only longer and usually deeper and certainly taller than pellet, but you also need to store more wood, which is a hidden "space" that most don't consider when making this decision.Gravity Feed again blends them. They are a bit bigger than pellet, definitely smaller than offsets, and can use more charcoal and lumps of wood instead of split wood (i.e. sticks), so you can have a bag of charcoal and a bag of wood chunks stashed away anywhere.**Time Requirements**This is a misnomer as bbq is bbq and there's no really good way to speed up a 12 pound brisket. What I mean by this is how much time you're willing to sit there and hang out with your smoker and monitor/baby your smoker.Pellet smokers are set and forget. You load up the hopper with pellets or disks, turn on your electric unit or propane tank, and forget it until you're ready to check on it many many hours from now. Want to go to the store and shop? Go to the store and shop. Want to put it on at 10pm and go to sleep and have it still rocking and rolling when you wake up? Then no matter how you answered any of the above questions, you might just want to get a pellet smoker because sleep and time are major factors, and if you have no time to smoke things, then why bother having a smoker?Offset smokers need constant hand holding and monitoring. These are the true "labor of love" type smokers. The ones where you grab yourself a cooler of beer, sit under some shade, and watch it and monitor it so that you can add more wood when needed, make sure smoke is steady, make sure meat is coming along nicely. Again, the produce the best flavor results, but also take the most monitoring to produce those results.Gravity fed are again, kinda the best of both worlds. You have a charcoal hopper on the side. Think "big ass version of a pellet hopper" to which you load up charcoal, then layer in 3-4 chunks of wood, more charcoal, more wood, more charcoal, more wood, and top with charcoal. Then you set it and kinda forget it. It will "feed" itself the charcoal and wood to keep the temperature steady and the smoke steady flowing. It does require a bit of monitoring because they are still brand new technology and only a few places can produce it because of patents (whatever company owns masterbuilt bought out char broiler, so they can use the patent for both. That's why they're so similar outside of cooking chamber design). But it's as close to set and forget as non-pellet can get. And you control the smoke via how much wood hunks (not chips) you add to the layers of charcoal. You can also add more chunks of wood under the fire where the ashes collect to add more smoke if you need it.So there you have it. There are various models of pellet and offset. There are only a few options for gravity fed because of the patents. All those huge rigs you see at competitions or smokehouses are going to be offsets. They can be small or they can be 1,000 gallon chambers. But they are still offsets. I mention that so you don't think that offsets = enormous. They can be smaller but will never be as small/compact as pellet or gravity. Gravity is more of the vertical type but still offset, as are most pellets. Wsm is what you want. Simple enough for a beginner but good enough that you never really need more. You can add digital controllers later on but I would start without. Everyone is going to have a different answer.  I always say go with a cheap electric vertical and buy a pellet tray.  You're not breaking the bank, if it never gets used you're not out much money, you're not having to worry about constantly adjusting it, and you'll get delicious tasting food.  If you enjoy the hobby after a couple seasons you can upgrade and sell the electric second hand or keep it as a back up. Look into gravity fed smokers. Set it and forget it > WSM, better smoke flavor than pellet, the Master built series look like a boss. Get a Masterbuilt Gravity. Pick your size and just enjoy it. You will never regret it

I would suggest [Recteq]( it has precise temperature control, large cooking area, and it's quite easy to use. Recommend. Budget range matters.You basically have 3 tiers of quality and price range: sub $750, $1000-$2500(ish), and $3500+.A pit boss is a good quality entry level smoker. I used a pit boss pro series for 2 years before upgrading to a Camp Chef Woodwind Pro.BTW, here's the [Amazon Link of Pellet Grills Suggested by other Reddit Users]( here. My Traeger turned into an annual repair project, so I wanted something more dependable and replaced it with a Grilla. I originally bought a Z grill because it was highly recommended to me and was cheap. I used it and loved it.I later decided to upgrade and wanted something bugger and higher quality. I learned about the "relationship" between z-grill and Grilla and ended up with a Silverbac. The Grilla Silverbac gave me the quality and size increase I wanted. The quality to price ratio also seemed unparalleled, which was nice. A lot of online research. Google but also use the word ‚Äúforum.‚Äù There are a ton of old school bbq forums with good info, this way you know you‚Äôre not getting some website who is paid to advertise. Traegers are awful bang for your buck, and cheapo pit bosses, etc will start to rust out after a few years. I was looking at rec teq and grilla. Ultimately went with a RT, no complaints, thing works great. I‚Äôm sure that grilla would‚Äôve been the same. If you want to spend more, there‚Äôs always Yoder, mak, pitts and spitts, etc. I personally wouldn‚Äôt go cheaper than RT or grilla though unless you plan on tossing after a few years.

I use [Cambro containers]( they're used in most commercial kitchens and are pretty indestructible. You can also easily get replacement lids. Pyrex. Tends to last FOREVER. That‚Äôs why your grandma still has/uses it. I really like the IKEA 365+ food containers! Not sure anything glass is "BIFL" if you drop them, but they've held up very well since I've got them. I've just recently picked these up so not sure how BIFL they are but Stasher bags are silicone reusable replacements for zip lock bags. Seems like there are multiple silicone bag brands out there. Glasslock is the best I've used.

I‚Äôve been using ‚ÄúAveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion - Fragrance Free‚Äù. I like it so far. I did notice it helped get rid of the dry bumps on the back of my arms. My dermatologist suggested Amlactin and my skin LOVES it. Not wonderful smelling, but not too off putting and doesn't linger. My skin is happily hydrated and soft. Vaseline Intensive Care lotion. I use the non greasy one on my face and the regular one all over after a shower. aveeno has great options! Been using Aveeno for decades!

Xerjoff SymphoniumDuring summer it was: MM Replica Matcha MeditationMaison Mahata Escapade GourmandeGuerlain AA Mandarin BasilicMM Replica Lazy Sunday MorningDiptyque Fleur de Peau 1. Byredo Bal D'Afrique2. Le Labo Santal 333. Le Labo Another 134. Byredo Mojave Ghost5. Byredo Gypsy WaterFell in love with these two houses and sort of gave up on the rest of my collection (100+ bottles). Really into simple clean fragrances at the moment 1.  Orto Parisi Stercus2. CDG seqouia 3. Beaufort Tonnere4. Tom Ford Fucking Fabulous 5. Fzotic Ummagumma I love them all so much and I think it says a lot about how bold, complex and thoughtful I am.  I like my perfumes to have both dark and light, and an intensity that is androgynous.  My fashion sense is ‚Äúa goth who likes color too much‚Äù and my perfumes follow! 1. Spicebomb Infrared2. Dior Homme Intense3. Penhaligon‚Äôs The Uncompromising Sohan4. PDM Layton5. ADG Profondo That‚Äôs a really hard one.  Here‚Äôs my best effort:1) Dior - Bois D‚ÄôArgent  2) Louis Vuitton - Ombre Nomade  3) Creed - Green Irish Tweed  4) Initio - Side Effect  5) Tom Ford - Tobacco VanilleAnd finally, for sentimental reasons, Abercrombie & Fitch - Fierce.  I worked there while Mike Jeffries was CEO.  Contrary to popular opinion, it‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever felt included in my life and is my favorite job to date and toward the top of my most treasured life experiences.  I can‚Äôt even really wear it anymore without getting emotional about how what I loved was ruined by new leadership and mob mentality.  Anyway.

Good old safety razors. I have a hand-me-down Gillette from my grandfather and buy blades online ($0.05 each). I use a double edge safety razor.  You‚Äôll need to experiment to see what you like (aggressive vs not-so-aggressive head, heavy handle vs light handle).  I prefer heavy and aggressive and I go for the Razorock SLAB head with a Muhle R89 handle with feather blades.  I usually shave every day but if I time my shaves right, I can pull off shaving every other day.  I‚Äôve been using the same setup for almost ten years now.  While you‚Äôre getting a nice razor, don‚Äôt forget the prep - nice brush, oil, shave cream, and aftershave.Edit: Also, if you end up going double edge safety route, watch a couple of tutorials before your first shave or you‚Äôll cut yourself up pretty good - not like jugular or anything, just small cuts that are a PITA.  It takes a little finesse but once you get the technique down it‚Äôs easy.  Also, I‚Äôve found the safety razor to be a better quality shave and less irritating to sensitive skin, even when you make a couple passes with it (with grain, across grain, against grain). I love my Merkur safety razor, perfect angle, no nicks or cuts on me in 20+ years of use. Very satisfying shave.    Best razor/shaves I've had.Mine's the 38c, but Pick your favorite, 34c, 38c, 39c etc. in short or long handle. A great blade is required also, I prefer Merkur's platinum stainless double edge blades, but you might want to buy a sampler pack of different brands to discover your blade by feel, and length of usability. And as suggested, visit r/shaving for a journey down the rabbit hole that is shaving. Are you open to a straight razor? or is it newer stuff only? As stated - Dual edge safety razors are great. Stirling soap.com has excellent starter shave kits with less aggressive heads for beginners. Just practice your technique and you‚Äôll be golden. Also, a pro tip I‚Äôve learned. Store your razor head submerged in a cup of mineral oil (~4 at a pharmacy) it will prevent your blade from oxidizing and will prolong its useful life exponentially. Since I‚Äôve started doing this, I use 1 blade (Persona) every 2-3 months shaving 2x a week.

You can extend the life of the razor you like by a billion percent:1.  Get a coffee cup.2.  Get a bottle of [mineral oil]( which is ~$5.3.  Fill coffee cup up to the 2" mark with mineral oil, get a fresh blade on your new razor and drop it, business end first, into the oil.You have just increased the lifespan of ANY razor you use by 7823%.Why and how:  Oxygen corrodes the blade which dulls the blade.  When you store the razor sans oxygen for 99.98% of the day, you remove 99.98% of corrosion.  You remove the razor while lathering and/or kant the blade so it drips into the cup.  Shave as normal.  Clean blade as normal.  Drop into oil.  If you are traveling, one can use an old peanut butter jar with lid instead of a coffee cup.You will use less than 6 razors per year using the above advice.Add mineral oil once a quarter or so as the level naturally drops.  DO NOT use another type of oil or add anything to the oil.  If you use anything other than 100% pure mineral oil, the oil will go to the dark side and smell like a dumpster fire at a Thai restaurant. I have a Merkur brand, I'm not sure the number but looks a lot like the 34C. It's got a short handle and a nice weight. I cannot recommend it enough. I also recommend Feather brand razors. This is what I've been using this combination for about 7 years. Very happy with my set up. I switched over to a safety razor and while there is a little bit of a learning curve, it‚Äôs the best shave I‚Äôve ever had. I bought a Chieftan brand one on Amazon and I‚Äôm sure there are better ones but it‚Äôs stains less steal and gets the job done. If you‚Äôre worried about more sensitive areas, the Leaf razor might be a better choice I‚Äôve heard great things about Leaf. Super in love with my Leaf razor. Uses safety blades that come really cheap, has a more modern tilt head design. It's super heavy weight and solid metal. I don't plan on buying a razor ever again!

I really like Clinique‚Äôs cleansing balm. It does a great job getting off my makeup without stripping the moisture from my face. I‚Äôve also found that using a little bit of face oil on my dry face before cleansing has done just as well. I use the Trader Joe‚Äôs Vitamin E oil, which is really gentle on my skin, removes my eye makeup, and you really can‚Äôt beat the price. Farmacy clean green balm!!  Green Clean is the GOAT. I double cleanse with this every day and it‚Äôs so gentle for contact wearers. Not sure if it‚Äôs still going on but on their website has $25 off if you spend $50. I really like cleansing oils! I have a tatcha one currently but am planning to get a cheaper one next time as I feel they all are the same. I prefer the oil to everything else I‚Äôve tried. I find it gets my make up off better I like Bioderma (pink cap) micellar water for soaking off my eye makeup with a well-saturated cotton pad. I'll often saturate a cotton bud too and run it along my waterline area to make sure I'm removing every trace of mascara.I've never experienced irritation from it, but then I have never rubbed and scrubbed as some other people do.Most days, Clinique's TTDO is good enough on its own as my first cleanse to remove all my makeup and sunscreen.

Mines will probably be surprisingly the cheapest brand on here. They‚Äôre always sold out at Ulta, and it‚Äôs for a reason. Essence Lash princess for only $5 and it‚Äôs about the best mascara I‚Äôve ever used, AND I‚Äôve used a lot of high end mascaras within the lines of Tarte, Benefit, Clinique and Lanc√¥me‚Ä¶ Tubing mascara!  I really love Loreal double extend.  However, I just saw a trick on IG for those who get raccoon eyes -- use whatever mascara you need for volumizing, thickening etc and then apply 1 coat of tubing mascara to lock all that goodness in place. I have yet to try this but I will soon. Maybelline Sky High in waterproof. Seriously the best. I have long lashes without curl, and due to chronic illness I rub my eyes often. The mascara leaves my lashes still just as curled, until 16h later. I've repurchased a few times, and I don't think I'll get another one soon. Roller lash :) it separates my lashes so nicely - my lashes get so stuck together with other ones I swear by l‚ÄôOr√©al Telescopic, it separates the lashes beautifully and really lengthens them, I love it.A bit off topic but lots of people raved about Lanc√¥me‚Äôs Monsieur Big, but I absolutely hate it. It looks very clumpy after just one coat and it just ain‚Äôt it. Has anyone had the same experience with that mascara?

Aquaphor, but not the lip repair one just the normal aquaphor. it comes in these small little togo squeeze bottles and theyre the only thing that works for me My recipe is thus:1. Use a soft (kids) toothbrush dipped in Vaseline or Aquaphor, gently brush the dead skin cells off your lips. Be careful as you can cause irritation if your brush is too stiff or your brushing is too forceful. You can also use a damp washcloth with a little cream rubbed on for this. (Sugar scrub also works. I've made my own with a little sugar and olive oil. If it makes you happy, just buy the fun yummy ones from Lush or Sephora.) 2. Wipe gently with a damp cloth to remove excess cream and skin. 3. While the lips are still moistened from the damp cloth, apply a hyaluronic serum to your lips. I use the Ordinary brand hyaluronic acid.4. Finish with a layer of Aquaphor or your choice of nourishing occlusive cream. I use a vitamin E oil from Shoppers Drug Mart (Canadian here). I usually do this right after brushing my teeth.Also look into drinking more water if you don't already. If you do drink water and you still have chapped lips, *look into adding electrolytes* to your water. You can still be dehydrated and drink lots of water because what you truly need from the water is to correct the balance of minerals in your body.I buy a hydrating mix from Within Us which has collagen and your essential minerals in stick form, there are plenty on the market, but you can ease into it by trying to add a (low/no sugar) Gatorade to your daily drink repertoire. I got really good advice on Reddit a while back that you need to moisturize your lips then apply an occlusive layer of product like Vaseline or aquaphor to lock the moisture in. That was life changing for my dry ass lips. After I brush my teeth I put a drop of my hyuroic acid serum then a light layer of unscented lotion and top it off with a regular lip balm during the day or a lanolin balm at night. I love palmer‚Äôs cocoa butter stick. I‚Äôve lived in the northeast USA most of my life and cocoa butter was a game changer. It‚Äôs not the lip balm‚Äîspecifically the cocoa butter stick [like this!]( I love the Jack Black ones. My favorite is the shea butter and vitamin e

I'm assuming its a local brand,but its cheap and they have a massive verity of colours I like Sally Hansen cuz its inexpensive. I also really like ILNP, and HoloTaco. My all time favorite is Mooncat, and I also have a decent amount of Cirque Colors and Cupcake Polish. They all have great formula and a variety of unique special effects polishes.
I've been wanting to compare top nail polishes on the same hand at the same time for awhile now. So we purchased the top 10 most popular nail polish brands and nail polish colors on the market. I kept the same base coat and top coat for this 7 day test to see if there would major differences between each nail polish. Let me know if you were surprised with my results.

I have been a fan of CONAIR for many years and have faithfully used their products. I used to own one of Professional Ionic Salon Hair Dryer 1875w . It dries my hair really fast. But then it got burned out. Then I switch to regular target cheap hair dryer which is so loud and takes twice as long to dry my hair. CONFU is a great dryer, gets the job done. There are times that the air that first comes out is cold. I had an old ConAir hairdryer for almost a decade and was crushed when it finally stopped working. then i jump in to JINRI Overall this is a very nice professional quality hair dryer that works quickly A week ago I would have said I loved INFINITI PRO BY CONAIR dryer. However it just stopped working with a poof of smoke and burning smell

I‚Äôve been shaving Norelco shavers for over 20 years, this model is clearly the Best Shaver Yet! Wahl razor gives me an excellent close shave and is easy to use. This is the second one I have purchased for after many years. once I used Panasonic Arc4 Electric Razo and it is waste of money. I am so sick of spending money on things only to be disappointed. It's so frustrating to feel all this hair after passing this shaver over the same spot 5 or 6 even 7 times. I have used Philips Norelco for about a month and a half and it has been working very well. I get about a month on one battery charge. The shave is nice and close but it took about a week for my face to get used to this shaver . Philips Norelco One Blade Hybrid Electric Trimmer and Shaver  is my best one. I was in a trouble. Because,  My wifey blamed me everyday. because, she not like my beard. after shave, there were extra hairs. So, I wanted to buy a best shaver. My friend told me to buy this phillips one. Now, I can take a clean shave for my face because of this shaver. My wife is also happy. Which one would you recommend to get a super super close shave that pretty much make the hair non visible

Highest quality has to be mous, phone rebel and nomad in no particular order. I've always come back to Spigen for every device. Can't get enough of it. Love the ones with stands built in, but this last phone one, I needed to get one that allows mag charging, but it's still sleek and protective. I‚Äôve used the Spigen Liquid Air series for my last 3 phones now. Not too bulky but adds decent protection. Looks minimalistic as well. Absolutely love my Nomad Goods case.

What do you regard as ‚Äúdecently priced‚Äù? The suggestions so far are good for what might be regarded as Budget spinners. Few places with premium spinners actually keep stock on hand anymore. You‚Äôre more likely to see PreOrders and Drops which are ‚Äòfirst come, first served‚Äô.When you‚Äôre ready to explore premium pieces I‚Äôd suggest starting with KAPEDC (Kinetics Asia Pacific). They always have great pieces and they frequently restock the most popular designs.  Spinetic spinners is a great budget option So I am newer to this and I can tell you that for the price, the best ones I have found are various metal spinners at  are my favorite: Most of us in this sub-reddit prefer metal spinners, and they generally cost more than the three-arm plastic ones that used to be everywhere when the spinner fad was big.  You buy metal spinners one at a time -- they don't come in a pack with more than one.I agree with the suggestions that others have made, both spinetic spinners and addictivefidgettoys are good sites for inexpensive metal spinners.  If you buy spinners based on any of these suggestions, please feel free to post about what you think on this sub! Lol wut

Honestly, in my experience (and it seems to be a common theme) is that most of us rarely use any of the fancy features, so the more basic model is more than enough. I have two Duos, 6qt basic duo and the 10qt Duo Nova (which they don't seem to have anymore, looks like the duo plus) and they are both awesome. I think the bigger decision is the size to get. A 6qt is great for most things, but I LOVE my 10qt for batch cooking. It's giant though, I'm glad I have the 6qt for day to day stuff. So if you're batch cooking, you might want to look at the 8qt (I wish I had gotten the 8 to begin with, but it's nice having two so it all worked out.) My sister has the 3qt and it's adorable! So it depends on your storage space, if you're batch cooking, and how many people you're cooking for. Instant Pot got bought out and expanded the brand to the point of confusion. Keep it simple. Buy 3 separate things: air fryer, pressure cooker & rice cooker.The sub $100 instant pot duo 6 quart model is the standard you want. Use the money saved to buy a ‚Äúceramic coated‚Äù nonstick aluminum pot insert & glass lid if you want to slow cook.The dedicated food buttons are easily replicated with manual pressure & time. The yogurt function is the only button that operates in the bacteria growth temp range that is useful for rising yeast based bread dough and making yogurt w/lactobacillus bacteria that you can‚Äôt manually set (ie buy a model with that function). I have an older Duo as well. And it‚Äôs great, I really only use saut√© and manual pressure cook. I have a large air fryer so I didn‚Äôt need the air fry portion. I am looking to upgrade to the Pro in the future. I will say the 3qt is tiny. It‚Äôs great for sides like rice or potatoes or doing hard boiled eggs. But I use my 6qt for everything else. I recommend getting an Instant Pot instead. I got the Yedi brand, comes with lots of accessories, made in same factory and cheaper. Had it 3 years now, not a single issue.

All my externals are WD.  I've used Seagate in the past and honestly they have been hit and miss with longevity.  Go with a Green series as externals tend to be leveraged for archival purposes.  So far I've had them for 6 years.  Note in the end HDDs do fail as they are mechanical. Western digital is very reliable. I recommend this one -> TOSHIBA Canvio Basics 1TB

Locking this thread because a bot keeps posting the same affiliate site. Feel free to post again. I‚Äôm just trying to stop the spam. We have Maine Coon so the amount of cat hair was getting unbearable. Tried some lower Roomba few years ago, but it was not enough. Now we have [this one]( and are very happy with it. It has mapping, its not loud and works very well with even big amounts of hair etc.. Sharks tend to not have the same longevity as other bots from what I have seen but I have not owned one myself. A Roborock s5 max would probably be a great choice if you don't want a bigger investment.Roombas are about as lond as they were since the 600 series.

Best coffee I've ever had came from a $40 Aeropress. Simple, efficient, and has replaceable parts. Technivorm moccamaster will be the common answer here. I keep saying I‚Äôll buy one after my OXO Barista Brain 9-cup dies, but it‚Äôs been going strong for 6 + years, so that one isn‚Äôt a bad option either. If you are spending that much on a drip machine, you‚Äôll also want a grinder ‚Äî baratza encore will be fine if you aren‚Äôt interested in espresso, and they sell parts online for easy replacements/repairs. Will also second the suggestion for an aeropress if you find that you mostly only make coffee for yourself. I‚Äôve lost track of how long I‚Äôve had mine. Do you want drip, espresso, pour over? Lots of different options here Chemex has no moving parts and makes amazing coffee. If you don't break it, it will truly last forever. Moccamaster hands down if you want a drip brewer. Not much else comes close to this brewer in terms of BIFL. Aero press or chemex if you‚Äôre more ‚Äúhands on‚Äù

My garmin forerunner 35 only just broke, and I bought it in 2017. They sent me a new one for a ¬£50 charge. It only broke that was because I got the strap caught in the car door and I snapped the connectors. The actual computer bit was still going strong. Did everything I needed from it, GPS for runs/cycles/swims and generic activity. The only thing I missed when I switched from fitbit was the automatic activity tracking, but actually I don't feel the need for it anymore. Garmin Forerunner! i have a fitbit versa 2 and i really like it! i bought an apple watch at one point but it really bothered me that it was more of a smart watch than a fitness tracker. (i also felt like the smart watch features werent that great‚Äîsure you can answer a message on your apple watch, but it was so inconvenient to do so). i also found myself missing the fitbit app when i had the apple watch, the fitbit app is just really user friendly and i had been so used to it at that point that i returned the apple watch and got my now versa 2!i have had other fitbits in the past, i have tried the charge line i think its called? and those have all been great as well, i just prefer the look of the versa2 and all the extra features it comes with at this point. theres also i believe the sense line now and the versa 3 (and maybe 4?) my sister has one of those and i like having the actual button on the side that the versa 2 has, which is why i keep sticking with it! I used an apple watch back in 2019 and then switched to a WHOOP, and now I am back to an apple watch. Didn't love the WHOOP for a few reasons- mostly being it didn't track splits for runs (i have no idea how this even is in production without mile times...) and did not track steps. It does have great components such as HRV and sleep/recovery data but personally for me it was too much having an electronic tell me how I should feel waking up every morning based on my recovery. The apple watch is great for running and I find it to be very accurate. Also very comfortable. Apple Watch. Fitbit is garbage. They manufacture a product designed to fail so that their customers will buy replacements. They also tie their warranty to the original device and it doesn't re-set when you get your replacement. So when the replacement fails, you're no longer within the warranty period and have to buy a new device. But, they'll give you a coupon to buy a new one - even though the one you just had and its replacement both broke. üôÑ I called Fitbit out on it and they blocked me on Facebook so take that as you will. I'll happily pay $300-$400 for an Apple Watch over a $100-$200 Fitbit that is designed to fail. I bought my Series 5 Apple Watch for sale in 2020, and it's still going strong 3 years later. I never had a Fitbit that lasted even 2 years before needing replaced.

Not sure if it‚Äôs the best, but I own a Ninja and like it. Easy to clean up and operate. The Ninja! got it a while back after reading a recommendation on a similar post and it's amazing piece of tech edit: there are a few models, here is the link i bought it from [ (it's on the number 1 in this list) I have owned 3 different air fryers and I will share my thoughts on them.  I am a single dad with a 16 year old son who lives with me.  I cook at home 95% of the time, and I value ease of use and convenience for cooking during the week.  I eat a relatively clean diet with as little processed foods as possible.  My son plays sports and I workout 4 days a week.  We consume a lot of food.  Realistically, the amount of food he and I eat would support a family of 4.  I say that so you understand the strain I put on these machines.Power XL (10qt I think): This was the first air fryer I bought.  I got it at Sam's Club.  This thing got put through the ringer.  It had the functions to dehydrate and all that, but I never used it that way.  Every night it was loaded up with proteins and vegetables.  It did a great job of cooking everything from chicken wings to pork loin to salmon.  Things cooked quickly and you always ended up with a nice crust (if that is what you were aiming for).  Was excellent for cooking wings.  The limitation it had was size.  As stated above, we eat a lot of food.  These machines rely on airflow to do what they do.  When you overload them, you are sacrificing the quality of your results.  I also used it to roast vegetables in.  Worked fantastic for that as well.  My son would cook frozen french fries and stuff in it and they seemed to always come out great.  Very good for heating up food too.  Clean up was not too bad.  I would run the racks through the dishwasher.  I would cover the drip tray in aluminum foil to make clean up easier as well.  I used a damp microfiber towel to wipe down the interior.  After about 10 months, I blew the thermal overload fuse.  Honestly, I got my money's worth out of it.  It was a great machine.  Just a little small for my purposes.Emeril Lagasse Power Airfryer 360:  Bought this one at Costco after I killed the other one.  Since you already know what and how I tend to cook in an air fryer,  I will just give you my thoughts on this one.  It was bigger which seems like a plus.  It just didn't perform the same as the power xl.  I think the larger size effected the performance (I didn't really realize this until later).  Wings didn't get as crispy.  The crust on a pork chop just wasn't the same.  It had a nice user interface that was simple to use.  Clean up was about the same.  The biggest issue was that the digital screen went out after about 2 months.  I took it up to Costco and they gave me a refund for it.  They didn't have any more in stock, so I decided to do some research and go another route for a replacement.Instant Pot Omni Plus:  I ordered this one on amazon after reading a lot of reviews.  This one is actually bigger than the Emeril.  Great user interface.  Simple of setup type of cooking and timer.  Had a lot of great functions.  Was more than big enough to roast a whole chicken using the rotisserie.  Once again though, size meant sacrificing airfryer quality.  This thing is more akin to an oven than an airfryer.  It would produce better chicken wings than a full size convection oven, but not dramatically better.  The biggest issue I had was the smoke.  Wow, did this thing smoke!  No matter how well I cleaned it, it would smoke up the kitchen like mad.  I ended up using it on the back patio because of it.  Moving it in and out of the house nearly everyday became too much, and I found myself just using my convection oven instead.  So after about 6 months it ended up going bye bye.For now, I am just using the convection oven.  I might venture back into the airfryer market at some point.  We will see.  My general takeaways are that an airfryer works because you can concentrate lot of heat and airflow in a compact space.  That gives you the results you would expect from a good airfryer.  When you go up in size, you lose that effect due to the limitations of the power output the larger machines have in relation to their size.  If you are cooking a reasonable amount of food for 1 or 2 people, you can buy a 10-12 quart machine and get great results.  Honestly, I wouldn't go overboard buying one with all the bells and whistles.  That is just me though.  I am not proofing bread dough or dehydrating foods, so I don't need all of that.  If you do, you might want a machine that will do all of those things.  For my purposes, a simple to use user interface combined with a high output heating element and a good fan is all I would want.  Maybe some other people's reviews on here will help me decide if I want to buy another one or not.  Anyways, just thought I would share my thoughts and experience. There is no such thing as an air fryer that actually fries food.They are basically tiny convection ovens with extra fans.They are great for reheating things and baking breaded items but they won't work with battered things the same way an actual fryer would. The New York Times Wirecutter team just re-iterated their (correct) stance on air fryers and list their recommendations: you are paywalled out , they recommend this Cuisinart: for most uses unless you are really short on space in which case they recommend this pod shaped (lower capacity) device:

I like the ecobee and Honeywell smart bc they are cheap and work.   Currently have an ecobee and the app is great since we don‚Äôt use a schedule The new [ecobee Premium]( is really nice. (Or any of the other models for a bit less cash.) I've had an ecobee for almost six years. You can keep it really simple or take a deep dive into a wide array of settings, control, and automation options.To your point, in my house we let the heat drop at night (blankets don't cost anything to use!) and then I have a "morning" schedule that starts the heat about half an hour before it's time for everyone to get up for school and warms up the house for that first groggy hour. Then it goes into the regular "home" or "away" schedules for the day.Technically this can be achieved with just about any smart thermostat, but I think the ecobee is the best piece of thermostat industrial design and app out there right now. (Side note: I work for a commercial thermostat manufacturer. Ours aren't as nice.) I agree with ecobee. It should be compatible with underfloor heating. You can set schedules so that it cools at night and starts warming in the morning, though you will probably have to use trial and error to figure out the ideal time for it to start heating. If you have times nobody is home, you can schedule it to heat less during those times as well. I‚Äôve only ever used the nest thermostats. It‚Äôs always worked well for me We‚Äôve got three ecobee lites and have had them in for a few years. No complaints.

My dentist recently suggested that I buy an electric toothbrush. I didn't   want to spend a ton of money before I knew if I'd like them so the price   on this was perfect. The Oral-B Pro1000 is user friendly and seems to   have a long lasting battery. I bought this AquaSonic to its affordable price compared to Phillips. When it works, it was great, no complaints. However, several months later the toothbrush stopped charging and the battery dies. So sad !!!!  I knew Panasonic as a surprisingly good quality brand with a lot of hidden gems like these. Does a great job with the finish cut. High quality precision cut. Durable. AquaSonic Duo Dual is excellent product, quality and design. After charging for 24 hrs - battery lasts for about 6 weeks of use. The extra brush heads and travel cases are added bonuses. I highly recommend this toothbrush set! Largely, dentists recommend Oral-B products because they perform well

Sennheiser PC37X or PC38X IMO you should avoid any "gaming" headsets, they generally aren't great compared to what you can get for a similar price when shopping for a separate headset/mic.I recently picked up a Sennheiser HD560s and paired it with a $20 inline boom mic, the quality of both are so much better than any gaming headset I've ever owned.Edit: Lots of questions asking about the mic, [here's a link]( Ditch gaming headsets, get some thr HD560S instead. And some cheap $20 mic from Amazon Honestly I hated my arctis pros.

Happy with Breville Fast Slow Pro. It is my 1st such cooker; just prepared my 3rd dish from a recipe found in "Milk Street Fast and Slow: Instant Pot Cooking at the Speed You Need" (the book I am going to give a 5\* review). Looks great on the countertop, and works fabulous for what I managed to cook so far. Definitely a new adventure for me in the kitchen! Alchemy! BTW, the book mentions Instant Pot in the title, bur works w/ Breville and probably every other cooker. As far as pressure cooking goes they all work the same, but the duo plus and ultra have specific settings for thing as like yogurt and rice. I highly recommend getting the non-stick pot to go with it, it comes with a stainless steel pot that works well but clean up is tough if you‚Äôre going to be cooking stuff with heavy or cream sauces. Electric pressure cooker isn't a replacement for a slow cooker. It pretends it will slow cook, but it only heats at the bottom and doesn't have the thick stoneware vessel that makes slow cookers work. Ninja makes an electric pressure cooker that can also be used as an air fryer. I have one as well as two instant pots and have noticed no quality disparity. Having an air fryer is super handy too! Instantpot is the most well know brand (their marketing was spot on). However, what I like about IP over other brands is the stainless steel cooking pot. And most accessories on the market are made to fit this device. BUT you have another option on Amazon and I have bought 6 of this brand, GoWise USA, to date, [8 quart model currently on sale for $59]( 2 for myself, (I threw away my first one when the fuse in it blew - electrician was doing a thing and it blew the circuit - and I didn't know I could replace the fuse in it for only a few bucks. Grrrr) 1 for each of my daughters, and two for other gifts. And I'll probably buy more for gifts. Literally, everything about it is the same EXCEPT the electronic keypad is mirrored on the IP. The IP replacement seals, all the accessories, everything fits in this. I have had mine for now almost 7 years. Still use it all the time. The Mealthy CrispLid fits it as well. It has the same preset settings for rice, yogurt, soup, porridge, etc as the IP.One note: It does heat from the bottom as another commenter pointed out, but that does not mean that it doesn't slow cook.  The interior walls are metal, the pot is metal, and the thermostat keeps that metal heated to cook like a slow cooker. I have used it to make slow cooker meals with no modification, OTHER than to bring my dish up to temp more quickly on the saute or soup setting, then turn it to slow cook.  The slow temperature rise of slow cookers - especially when using raw meat - is the one thing food safety experts say is the danger in using slow cookers. This circumvents that.

also lookingedit: thank you! got the kitchen aid as well and loving it! it's a gorgeous beast edit: the exact one is the number 2 on this list here: [ KenwoodGrandmas has been going for a couple of decades, mum‚Äôs went for a couple of decads before I upgraded her, mine is fantasticAnd so many attachment options 100% recommend a Kitchenaid, the die cast body means it will last forever. One benefit of the steel body from my experience is the added weight means it won't move even when kneading dough at high speeds.You can get a Kitchenaid a lot cheaper than the NZ Kitchenaid store from Peter's of Kensington in Sydney. I paid about $750 (vs $1000-1100) for mine including shipping. I've got a Kitchenaid mixer and I wouldn't trade it for the world. My partner bought a breville (bakery chef hub) with extras for cheaper than a kitchenaid without the extras for bread making and it's really really good. We've had it for a few months and it's turned out great bread every time. It's a little noisy but that's to be expected with a stand mixer.All the reviews we read about kitchenaid said replacing parts is an absolute nightmare on top of the expensive extra tools.Partner says not to buy it from Noel Leeming (650) but to get it from Smith City for cheaper (around 469). We make a couple of different loaves a week (French rolls, rustic loaf, standard white bread etc)

Yeah I'm looking too Unless you live in a small studio apartment ‚Äúbest wireless router‚Äù is an oxymoron as an all in one device like that always suffers from one compromise or another.A router does one thing and one thing only, it passes network traffic from one network to another.   Typically between your local area network and your ISPs network.   It has nothing to do with WiFi.The problem is marketing.   What you are buying at Best Buy etc is three devices in a single box.   Because of that you often end up locating it in places that‚Äôs convenient for your ISP and bad for effective connectivity to the devices you want to use on the WIFI.If you truly want the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, you purchase a separate router that fits the capacity of your ISP connection with some headroom for future upgrades, and then buy separate Wireless Access Points that can be placed where they will provide the best possible coverage of your premises.   The upgrade cycle on the router is likely going to be far less frequent than that of your WAPs. If money is not an issue then you can go with Asus GT-AX11000 or [ASUS RT-AX3000]( which is a mid-range option that offers excellent performance and features at a more affordable price point than some of the high-end routers. It's dual-band operation and MU-MIMO and AiProtection should help to improve your network's range and security. I would like to prefer Asus RT-AX86U. This is an excellent router with great speed and features. It is still giving me a very good range and performance. You can compare this router with other [best wireless routers]( along with their features.

The TIMBUK! edit: make sure you looking at the latest one, it's the number 1 on this list:  [ I came here to say Timbuk2 as I love my bag‚Ä¶..but it looks like you want something different. You have me intrigued though so I will look up Tumi now. Tom Bihn. They are beautiful bags, beautifully thought out. They are very fussy about the fabric they accept  and very fussy about the detail work and stiching on the bags. They are made in America, around Seattle. The designs slowly evolve, the current Brain Bag fixes all my gripes about my 12 year old one (still looks almost new), I replaced it because I wanted a more snag free exterior (one of my kids has it now). Order a fabric sample set if you want to see what they really look like, and check out their forums. Usually, they go for 80% of new on ebay, which is really saying something. I have a Synik 30  Tumi has nerfed their quality. I love every bag I've gotten from Waterfield:

From what I've read they're very unreliable. Measuring through your feet doesn't give the best read and upper body measurements are often wrong. I love my Renpho, it still works great after 4 years. I think they're about $40 on Amazon now? I got an inexpensive set of calipers. I have a Renpho and the analytics seem off purely based on body weight. However, the number on this scale always aligns with the number I see on the scale I see at the doctor's office.

I‚Äôll use this thread to reiterate this piece of knowledge: If you want nuobells, keep watch on Saks Fifth Ave for deals as they by far have the most frequent and best deal on nuobells. Look for their scaling $$ deal and typically they will usually go $150 off orders of $750+. Not great when buying overpriced clothes, but for 80lb nuobells it‚Äôs better than anywhere else out there. Pair it with a cashback program for even more savings.Edit: Also free shipping was included I‚Äôm gonna add the PSA about Eleiko Evos. Some of the rotating dumbbells have lateral ‚Äúlooseness‚Äù. The handle feels loose and ‚Äúcompresses‚Äù into the dumbbell back and forth. This is especially prevalent on larger weights, and it‚Äôs not consistent. Meaning one 50lb might have more looseness than the other. As you can imagine, this feels terrible during a workout when one dumbbell feels unstable compared to the other. That one Malaysian YouTuber (Zealift) and Coop both confirmed the issue exists. Coop mentioned that it is minimal, but from my personal experience, it is substantial. What this says to me is that if you get Eleiko Evo rotating dumbbells, you WILL experience this. Emails to Eleiko says that this is part of the design to increase durability. If so it‚Äôs a terrible design choice, because the dumbbells feel broken.Video of perfect Evo of loose Evo dumbbell I have the un-branded rubber hex dumbbells from Rogue, 10's-100's.  Purchased them in the spring/summer of 2021 when they were on sale for a dollar per pound.  Saved on shipping by ordering a lot at a time or with other heavy items.  Until then, I had been using standard plates with old spin-lock type handles.  It sucked.  Never used adjustables like Ironmasters or Powerblocks.  I'm sure they suit most gyms just fine.  I thought the investment for a set was worth it as, for me, nothing beats the ability to just grip and rip! I have no regrets, other than I wish I would have purchased 110's and 120's, too. Shout out for luxiaojun dumbells at 0.95 usd a pound, shipping free in the us. I have a set of 5-45 which I use several times a week, and they are great for the price. Obviously urethane ones are better, but these are good enough for me. TLD;DR I‚Äôd say go REP straight handles in 5-100, take whatever you can get beyond that. My big girls (105-150) are pro style, not sure what brand. I really like the rep straight handles. They‚Äôre a good price compared to urethanes, and feel great in the hand. Good diameter, good knurl. I would definitely recommend them for most people who do enough dumbbell training to warrant buying a full set. I‚Äôve had powerblock u90s, they feel so awkward for pressing movements with the added weights making them top heavy (and still aren‚Äôt heavy enough for chest presses and rows, I only tried them for shoulder presses) and too clunky for curls, and the contoured plastic handle feels terrible in the hand. The powerblock ‚Äúpersonal trainer‚Äù 50lbs non-expandable set is nice for curls and things like that, but obviously too light for presses and rows. I used to use loadable 20‚Äù olympic handles for rows, they worked OK for that but were a bit clunky. Definitely way too clunky for curls. It is a very cheap way to go heavy though, I think the heaviest I ever went was 145lbs. If you had dumbbell spotters, I reckon you could do presses just fine but I would be nervous unless I had exceptionally good collars. I almost prefer standard size spin-locks just due to the reduced size. That‚Äôs what I had starting out and honestly they did an adequate job for most things. Don‚Äôt even talk to me about that breakable plastic bowflex garbage.Would love to hear feedback/input from ironmaster/pepin/baadass owners who train in a bodybuilding or powerlifting style.

I have been a fan of CONAIR for many years and have faithfully used their products. I used to own one of Professional Ionic Salon Hair Dryer 1875w . It dries my hair really fast. But then it got burned out. Then I switch to regular target cheap hair dryer which is so loud and takes twice as long to dry my hair. CONFU is a great dryer, gets the job done. There are times that the air that first comes out is cold. I had an old ConAir hairdryer for almost a decade and was crushed when it finally stopped working. then i jump in to JINRI Overall this is a very nice professional quality hair dryer that works quickly A week ago I would have said I loved INFINITI PRO BY CONAIR dryer. However it just stopped working with a poof of smoke and burning smell

I like Makita. However, as others have said, battery life is not what one would hope. My 3-year old Makita impact driver now has both batteries showing "failure" when I plug them into the charger. I'm not happy about that. I did expect them to lose capacity but not to out & out die and become unchargeable at all. Why not replace the battery pack?  It's likely that has worn out.Check for off brand battery packs for your model. Check out Primecell.com. They rebuilt 4 Festool 12v batteries for me recently and they're working perfectly now. Hey team, I'm a former powertool corporate guy. I used to be a buyer and regional sales manager for a tool store chain, and I know pretty much every brand under the sun. My best advice;If you want a great drill, get a Festool. If you want a great drill for under $1000, get a Makita. The warranty is fantastic, parts are extremely easy to get, and they last very well (the batteries too) in fact, if the batteries fail with professional use under two years and you brought them into my stores, we'd just give you a battery straight away as we would be 99.99% sure of the warranty claim being accepted. We used to sell Milwaukee but the main issue there was warranty claims being constantly denied (the warranty might be seven years, but they expect it to be worn out by then and will only pay out as such), Bosch are pretty good too, not for drills but for jigsaws, circular saws, an excellent go to they are. And Dewalt aren't too bad, but are in our experience overrated for the price point that they hold. What do I use? A corded drill. Sure it might not be the easiest thing to use but it's served me fine. In fact, my drill has been used by my father, grandfather, and great grandfather. It was first bought in the 1950's. I still use it weekly. I don't work there anymore, but if anybody has any questions about the brand, product (I went to China/Japan and toured factories), how the companies are to deal with, feel free to ask.  I have the Milwaukee M18 fuel Impact driver and I love it. I'm not a pro but I bought a fixer upper and have used it for everything. The standard batteries give you a ton of run time and charge fast.I also have the standard M18 drill from Milwaukee too. I also really like it but only really use it for drilling.You won't go wrong with Milwaukee.

We have a Fellow electric kettle. Precise temperature control. Set it to a specific temperature, it‚Äôll keep it warm for an hour before turning off.We‚Äôve had it for a year and it‚Äôs life changing honestly. Expensive but as long as it works we‚Äôll never need to replace it.  exactly life, but they last for a long time. I have a Breville electric kettle that's about 20 years old and shows no signs of age.  However, the real game changer was installing an Insinkerator hot water tap.  I've had that for about three years, so not long enough to really have an opinion about longevity, but it's great not having to wait for the kettle. Just to add, i try to only buy glass ones so they may not last forever because of accidentally breaking.  My current one is almost 10 years.  Something about boiling over and over in plastic or metal seems unhealthy..

The Breville everyone seems to recommend is the one I got earlier this year and it's been fantastic so far!edit: sorry forget to mention the model , it's the number 1 here:   Hurom juicer! I recommend the Breville as your first juicer. It will be the easiest as far as prep, juicing, and cleaning goes.I first got my breville 8 years ago, would juice almost daily. I got a masticating juicer earlier this year, and after 6 months of using,I have gone back to using my centrifugal. The quality of juice from the masticating is not that much better for me when I factor in the added work and time to prep, juice and clean.The best juicer for you is the one you will use daily! I did not like using the masticating juicer daily. The Breville is my daily driver! I can recommend [nutribullet slow juicer]( its not that costly and very good for its money. Easy to use, easy to clean, does its job very well. Definitely go with a slow juicer over a centrifugal

I‚Äôve been shaving Norelco shavers for over 20 years, this model is clearly the Best Shaver Yet! Wahl razor gives me an excellent close shave and is easy to use. This is the second one I have purchased for after many years. once I used Panasonic Arc4 Electric Razo and it is waste of money. I am so sick of spending money on things only to be disappointed. It's so frustrating to feel all this hair after passing this shaver over the same spot 5 or 6 even 7 times. I have used Philips Norelco for about a month and a half and it has been working very well. I get about a month on one battery charge. The shave is nice and close but it took about a week for my face to get used to this shaver . Philips Norelco One Blade Hybrid Electric Trimmer and Shaver  is my best one. I was in a trouble. Because,  My wifey blamed me everyday. because, she not like my beard. after shave, there were extra hairs. So, I wanted to buy a best shaver. My friend told me to buy this phillips one. Now, I can take a clean shave for my face because of this shaver. My wife is also happy. Which one would you recommend to get a super super close shave that pretty much make the hair non visible

The Schlage Encode Plus is good, but also take a look at the UltraLoq Z-Wave fingerprint deadbolt lock. *You will need a zwave hub to use it* Schlage Encode Deadbolt (good luck finding it in stock anywhere), I was lucky enough to purchase 4 of them before the shortage effected everything.  3 for my house and 1 for my grandmother who has a home health aide. I don‚Äôt know the current state of the company and their selection of products but AFAIK IglooHome makes the only smart lock that youtube lock pickers like Bosnian Bill or The Lock picking Lawyer approved of and did not regard as a piece of junk. The most secure deadbolt lock to me is the Yale nest smart lock. The problem with 99% of deadbolts, smart or not, if it has a cylinder, it can be picked. Personally, I have a ubolt ultraloq. My only regret to it today is I didn't get the zwave version. Not that my wifi version doesn't work, but for intregation to my security system zwave would have been better. I have 3 other doors with normal cylinder locks that I might upgrade later and use my wifi lock on another door and upgrade to either the zwave version or Yale lock on my main door. I like the August smart lock because you can use your own deadbolt with it, so you‚Äôre but limited to a junk lock with expensive tech attached to it. It replaces the thumb latch on the inside of the door. It takes about five minutes to install.The August had an app, of course, you can issue permanent and temporary ‚Äúkeys‚Äù depending on your needs (residents versus guests). Temporary keys can be set to work during certain times and expire.You can purchase an external keypad (Bluetooth) and set PINs the same way you would issue keys.It can work with or without a home hub. I use Apple and bought the zwave adapter so I‚Äôm able to unlock my door from anywhere in the world. If you buy just the lock, you‚Äôre limited to Bluetooth only. It runs on 4 AA batteries, which is great because you‚Äôre not dependent on electricity to be able to get in (like during a power outage), but you have to be physically at the door. Auto-unlock is a nice feature, especially when my hands are full. You setup a geofence in the app and once you leave the ‚Äúhome‚Äù area, once you re-enter, as you approach your door, it will unlock. Of course, you don‚Äôt have to use this feature, but I do because my hands are almost inevitably full of mail and groceries every time I go out. It has an auto-lock feature. After you close your door, after a pre-defined number of seconds, the deadbolt will lock.

Yeah Philips hue. I've purchased just about every brand of smart light and the hues (while the most expensive) have outlasted all the rest. I have multiple years old bulbs still working like new. Bite the bullet, replace them once and never look back Phillips Hue is the only brand I trust to install. I have 27 hue bulbs that are four years old. All of them are still going strong. I haven‚Äôt had a single failure. Definitely not TP Link.  I have had 8 of 10 bulbs fail within 1 year...  All the same way, they develop a weird oily substance on the inside of the bulb and then stop working.Echoing others, my Philips Hue bulbs keep going and going... I have had both Sengled and Ikea ZigBee bulbs.  Both have been rock solid.  I had wifi bulbs a few years back and they were crap.

You're overthinking it a bit. Either of those would be a perfectly good choice, but there's never a 100% guarantee that even a good product will perform without a single issue for decades. Shit happens and even the best products have *some* bad reviews.The only other one that's perhaps worth considering is the Magimix. Depending on who you ask, it's that, the Breville, or the Cuisinart in the top spot (although I think most people who like the Cuisinart would go for one of the others if you took cost out of the equation entirely). I have a Magimix and like it a lot, although I'd probably have gone with a Breville if I lived in the US. I have the Cuisinart.  I've had it for a couple years, and granted I don't use it all that often, but you can have it when you pry it from my cold, dead kitchen.  The thing works wonderfully, and the best side benefit for me is it is *quiet*.  Late at night before thanksgiving, making pie crust, and my old processor would wake the neighbors.  This one doesn't even wake the dog. Did you somehow run into me in the world, read my mind, and create this post? I‚Äôve been debating which one to buy for 3 months now! I've had my cuisinart for almost 20 years. Still works fine. I'm sure the Breville is good too, but if you're going to be swayed by the 1 star reviews, which account for 4% of all reviews, versus the 84% of 5 star reviews... That seems silly.

I've had a Husqvarna 430x for 2 years now. I have an enclosed, non-flat, non optimal lawn - 2300 square meters (.56 acres). If it died, I'd go buy a new one immediately. It's changed my relationship with my lawn.Pros:* I don't have to mow the lawn (2 hours in 30C+ heat, with a push mower, fighting the bugs)* It integrates with HA* My lawn looks amazing, even better than when I had a gardener, because it gets cut constantlyCons:* It gets stuck/turned off/falls off curbs fairly regularly. But not regularly enough to make me want to fix the root cause of the problem. At most it's 2 minutes to walk out, fix the problem and send it on its way.* It needs to run pretty constantly to ensure the lawn is well cut* I still have to do the edging myself.* Rabbits are attracted to the boundary and guide wires. They'll dig and chew them, resulting in wire breaks. Those are a joy to find.* Needs a boundary wire. Unfortunate, but less expensive than RTK GPS I have a Landroid, there is a HACS integration that has led to me building a control panel that greatly exceeds the function and stability of the actual Landroid app. I am also interested in well-recommended options. I was very interested to hear about [OpenMower]( but it is new enough that I think it still needs a bit of time to mature, support more devices/builds, and perhaps become integrated with services like HomeAssistant. I did not know this was a thing, and now I want the Husqvarna 430x The [Bosch Indego]( "+" models work with Home Assistant via a [custom integration]( can even set it up as a "vacuum" to make the UI a little nicer to use.

So I bought a really expensive tacx wheel on turbo trainer 16 years ago, I put a reasonable amount of mileage on my bike outside during the season and just never rode or trained in the off-season. As a purely recreational solo rider I couldn‚Äôt find the motivation to mindlessly spin on a regular basis. It was a total waste of money. I‚Äôd put on music or a movie and just lose concentration on what I was doing.I found out about Zwift, bought the speed and cadence sensor for it and the game element really appeals to me. Tracking progress, training programs, the social part. It was right up my alley. I immediately sold my wheel-on turbo and sensors two weeks in for a used elite Suito ($500), used that for two years (sold for $500) and this year bought a hardly used wahoo kickr V5 for $1200. We are talking ridden in game for 15km. Cassette was even clean. Buying used it very risky, I‚Äôm reasonably electrically/mechanically inclined.If I had advice for old me I would have gone straight to the direct drive kickr V5 even at full retail. Auto calibration is so convenient. You don‚Äôt have to think about that part of it, I was always doing the spin down cal on my Suito and it‚Äôs really nice just jumping on and get going. It‚Äôs quiet. The heavy flywheel gives a realistic feel even compared to my old Suito. My gf even signed up and uses my setup as well.If that is in your budget go for it. I know I‚Äôll have mine for years even if I upgrade my bike. If you end up not being into it you can sell it next fall when everyone is looking to buy. I bought a Wahoo Kickr Core last week and its been the best decision ever. I'm a beginner ish cycler(first season) and I LOVE Zwift. Definitely opt for a smart trainer at least, direct drive has been superb. I used Zwift all last winter and enjoyed it. Once I get past my fall marathon I'll get back on the saddle indoors for the winter.I'm certain I hit the road this spring in far better cycling shape from Zwift. It doesn't replace being outdoors, but it's so easy to get a decent workout. I like the planned workouts and did a six week FTP builder that really seemed beneficial.I have the Saris H3 trainer and am happy with it. I bought a Wahoo Kickr & Zwift about a month ago and it‚Äôs honestly the best investment I‚Äôve ever made for cycling training. I use it hours a day. Zwift has some really great training plans and the auto-calibration/ERG on the kickr is awesome. $$ very well spent, highly recommend going for it. In 2019 I used a dumb trainer with speed and cadence sensor, and it wasn‚Äôt much good. The power numbers weren‚Äôt too far off since it was a supported dumb trainer, but the higher the true numbers the further off the estimated ones were. In 2020 I got a power meter for outside and for with the dumb trainer, with the logic being that for the same price as a smart trainer I can get a pedal power meter that will work both indoors and outdoors and I‚Äôll get more use out of the purchase. There was nothing wrong with this setup, although it was quite loud. This year, I picked up a smart trainer and I love it. I do structured workouts, and that made it a whole lot easier to hold the power target since I don‚Äôt have to focus on anything but consistent pedalling. It‚Äôs also quite nice to have the resistance change on the gradients. Overall, it depends on your budget but I certainly recommend zwift.

I've found Life Extension's "Two-Per-Day" the one that works the best for me. High bioavailability isoforms, decent spectrum of vitamins and minerals, good price, and since the concentrations of each are fairly high, I need to take only one per day, so one bottle lasts very long... I only supplement it with an additional take of B12 (methylcobalamin) during the day, and some more magnesium (citrate cause I lean towards constipation). - Pure Encapsulations PureGenomics.  - Pure Encapsulations ONE Multi.  - Life Extension Two Per Day (kind of over dosed, so makes aa good one per day).   - Seeking Health makes a few.  - Naturelo makes a few.- Thorne Basic 2/Day Thornes multis, but darn pricy at retail.

All of those brands are reliable and big inventory as you can get from these companies Garden of Life also has [mykind Organics]( [New Chapter]( is another good brand.

If price isn‚Äôt an issue, you can‚Äôt go wrong with Thorne. Their mineral supplements are top-notch too.
Here are the best quality multivitamins you can buy for men, women, and kids. It's all about the quality of the ingredients, how diverse they are, and the other ingredients listed at the bottom. So many store bought multivitamins use added sugar, artificial flavors and colors, and bad quality synthetic vitamins. The good multivitamins are more expensive, but they are much higher quality and have a more diverse vitamin profile, they are definitely worth the money.Mad love..Bobby, Dessi, Rose, and Art! XOXO. .

If you're going USB mic, I love the elgato wave 3. It's solid audio and the software is very very helpful for streaming. Hyperx quadcast s. Looks great, sound quality is awesome, setup is fairly simple. Audio-Technica AT2020pair it with a Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen or a GOXLR and your good for years If you're in a noisy environment I recommend the Rode PodMic or Shure Sm58 paired with a Scarlett Solo or Berhinger U-Phoria UMC22 (not the UM2). If youre ina more calm enviroment where you can control HVAC or fans and its reletivly quite the AudioTechnica AT2020 or Blue Ember. ***I personally*** wouldn't recommend a USB mic because ***to me*** its just money being thrown away if you plan on upgrading.Having a dedicated mic and interface means you can buy an inexpensive interface and upgrade your mic then your interface when you start making money or decide streaming is something you want to continue. If money is tight you can get away with a U-Phoria UMC22 with a behringer xm8500. The only downside is you would need to buy a cable and stand separate but there pretty inexpensive on amazon.

I have an Anker 10,000 mAh (not sure which model). It's pretty old now, at LEAST 6 years, but it's quite light and a bit smaller than a deck of cards, I'm sure they're even better now. It'll charge a newer phone about 3x. Those cheap little chargers are usually about 1,000mAh and phones are around 3,000mAh so they're really not very good. You can get a 10k for like $25 and a 20k (six charges) for not much more, so it's worth the upgrade to one of those.I'm a big fan of the Anker brand and so I'd definitely buy from them again. The Anker Power bank, I think it's the 20000 mAh, charges a phone and a tablet multiple times no problem, takes a while to charge though nitecore nb10000. it's the lightest you'll find at that charge capacity. easily charges a cell phone 2-3 times Another vote for the Anker 10,000

eve energy is the best smart plug on the market. that is the answer. I‚Äôd go with eve. Philips has one as well if you have the hub Depends on your budget, I love my IKEA Tradfri plugs and the ability to control them independently of HomeKit (via bash) is a must. They are also very cheap. But they do require a ZigBee hub of some sorts.On the other end we have the totally hubless plugs like the Eve Energy which uses Thread and extends your Thread network. Those are quite nice as well but they are pricey. There are numerous other options from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth but I would caution you against using those. Choose either something HomeKit native like Thread or Matter or go for something that is universally supported like ZigBee or Z-WAVE.Either way later on you better stick to the same technology for best results as many of those plugs act as range extenders as well so a Zigbee plug into a Z-WAVE home is kind of useless - it will work but you will be using half of its features. VOCOlinc are cheap and reliable. But if I started over I would go with Eve I use the meross ones, cheap and fully HomeKit compatible. (Double check as they do none HK ones too)

I really like the Chamberlain belt drive with the MyQ. Very very quiet. Nothing worse than a noisy door opener, especially with that nice garage! Check out the [Wyze Cam V3 garage door opener]( It works with the majority of garage door openers, doesn't require a subscription, and includes a camera so you can monitor the garage as well. Don't think anything really competes at $45.I've installed these at my house and my parents house and it's been a good experience so far. The only caveat is you'll want a good wifi connection in your garage since the open/closed status is based on what the camera sees. LiftMaster/Chamberlain side mount garage door opener - with battery backup. Clears up a lot of overhead space and is a nice clean installation. The MyQ app is great too. I use MyQ. Available on Amazon. Works quite well. Easy setup.

Popular mechanics magazine did a test on water bottles not too long ago and most bottles that are vacuum insulated work the same way and offer insulation of hot/cold for many hours. It‚Äôs more or less personal preference of lids and shape/size that could be deciding factor. One thing I will mention is my yeti gets tossed in the dishwasher daily for the last four years and still looks great. Hydro flasks are not approved for dishwasher fwiw, I tried and the outside got stained and chalky. Hydro flask has great customer service when my screw top lids leaked they sent me three to replace my old ones. Zoj with this version.

Do not put hot beverages in this with the assumption it will cool. It will not. It takes like 10 hours. Put it in like you want to drink it. Middle pops out for cleaning.

Tried other brands but I‚Äôm spoiled now.Zoj mugs don‚Äôt go up to 30 ounces.Edit they have 35 ounce vacuum bottle and a different thermos looking one. I can't speak to your specific use case, but I once dropped my Zoji from a (slowly) moving helicopter onto the top of a mountain in Papua New Guinea and I'm actively drinking water out of it bottle as I type this. My yeti rambler is tough as hell. They have a lot of lid and size options, the chug would fit your criteria but i prefer the flip up straw. I left my 26oz in a hot car for 14 hours, and the water was still ice cold. I‚Äôm just looking for any bottle not made in China

The   MIDEA I got off amazon is a great unit, quiet, strong and budget friendly.(the exact model is the number 1 here:  ) Almost any AC is going to be noisy, it's just more about the how unpleasant that noise is.The LG 1419IVSM is what I have and it's solid. It's quiet-ish, fairly efficient as far as portable models go, and not bad looking. Just make sure you have a 20 amp circuit to plug it into or if you only have a 15, make sure that one isn't on a heavy load or it'll trip the circuit breaker. From what I've read make sure it's a dual hose design. I'm looking for one too. I heard Costco has one on sale right now that's pretty decent. I got the midea duo 12,000 btu and it‚Äôs incredible. I turn it on about 15 min before bed and it cools the room down quickly. Not too loud. Easy installation

But my mom got a cheapish one that makes a waffle on both sides, doubling waffle production, which is a pretty stupid thing for any waffle iron *not* to have.  I have a Nordicware waffle iron that you use on a stovetop. It takes up way less space than a dedicated appliance and is super easy to clean, and you can take it camping if you're into that kind of thing. You could also get a cast iron stovetop waffle iron.

I highly recommend [ If you have a common phone they probably have a custom mount for it specifically made for your vehicle. The best clamping style phone holder I have used is the RAM mount. Certainly more expensive than what you have looked at, but a minimal vibration mount was a factor as sometimes I like to use my phone to record drives. They even make a tri-suction mount that is super stable.  Ram x-mount with a suction cup base.I bought it for my motorcycle, but use it in cars too. I've had It for 5+ years and it is a tank.  100+mph in open wind and the phone isn't going anywhere. It's not any of the ones you recommended, but we have a [RAM Mount]( in our Jeep Grand Cherokee and it is by far and away the best phone mount I've ever used. I think the way they actually suction the thing to the windshield helps it be incredibly solid, I know they are generally popular within the Jeep community for that reason. I like the method in which it secures the phone too, it's like an X-Grip kinda thing that just clamps onto it pretty easily. Good luck in your search! If you live in a cold climate, stay away from the mounts like number 4 that clip onto the vents. Blasting the heat in the winter can cause some phones to overheat and shutdown.

I also have a germ guardian AC4825E for extra capacity and something to put in my office if needed. I think it's not quite as good a price ratio but it's still inexpensive and seems to work well.Edit: here is a thread I made about my research easier this year:  We have some winix models that we got from costco. They stay in the bedrooms and run 24-7 for multiple years and seem to work pretty well. I have the Honeywell HPA200 or 250. Got pretty decent reviews on consumer reports and seems to work good enough Alens are great but a bit pricey. work as well but they‚Äôre a value option, cost half of an Alen, I have 2 AP-1216 but the air quality sensor never worked, I suspect they don‚Äôt have one inside‚Ä¶

Bought a Tineco A11 master when it went on sale. Extremely impressed with it. Seemingly well constructed although anything battery operated won‚Äôt be BIFL. The soft roller works REALLY well for our hardwood floors  is where to find the answer for this as your question is NOT about lifespan but use case and we have no idea how big your place is and whether you do or do not have carpet.  Vacuums don't care about pets, that's where the marketing teams have snookered consumers.As stated before, the worst type of vacuum is a battery cordless.  Most are filterless.  Most put more dust back into the air as their filtration is terrible.  But if you have a tiny space, their pros may outweigh their cons.  The BEST vacuum will be a corded vacuum that uses bags and has HEPA filtration.  Best brands for those are Miele, Riccar and Simplicity.  If the prices scare you, you can get one for a song at your local vacuum repair store as they often have used one or eBay/craigslist/FB marketplace as not many know those names so they go for cheap. r/vacuumcleaners will be of great service here. They are incredibly knowledgeable. Lindhaus, SEBO and Miele are favorites in the segment. If you really want BIFL, skip the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù brands and maybe also consider corded (IK IK its less convenient. But batteries *will* fail and will wind up in a landfill) We have two cats and a dog, our Dyson vacuum handles them no problem.

Just go gas.  The electricity is coming from burned fuel. Your transportation will likely be gas fueled as well. I'm not trying to be snarky, but the electrics don't put out enough for heavy use.  The majority of pressure washing is for athletic appeal anyway and generally speaking a waste of water.   It's not really a green service to begin with. A sunjoe 2300 psi 1.6 gpm will work fine with 12-14 inch surface cleaners it should be great for whatever your need. We use Mi T M ChoreMaster 1400 on buses and other projects. They also make a 2400 PSI version. You can also just buy the motor/pump set up individually for relatively cheap to make your own setup. With the exception shown below electric is fine for light duty use, but gas is the way to get things done quickly. Even so, you have to find a 220 volt power source and those are hard to come by unless you want to also lug a generator, which is truly pointless.

I have a Eufy outdoor camera that I got around Christmas and I've been really pleased with it so far. I'm strongly considering getting more. I'll try to address all your specifics: My model (there are many!) has a built-in motion spotlight that can be turned on or off with the free app. I live in central Virginia and we've gotten some snow and wind with no issues, but nothing quite like what y'all get the northeast, so I can't speak to that. The video quality can be set to 1080p or 2k HD and I think the cost came in somewhere around $130ish. It stores feeds on an SD card (included but can be switched out) that you can watch on your app (via wifi), or I think you can buy a cloud subscription if you want more space (or maybe even monitoring?) You can also download videos on your phone if you want. Continuous recording is an option, but I haven't used it, so you'd have to do some research here if that's what you want. Mine is only set to record when it senses motion. There are different options for what kind of motion to look for (ie people vs pets) and you can also use the app to manually set the area you want it to pay attention to. Bonus is that it has a microphone, a speaker, and an alarm, so you can speak to people through it and also set off an alarm from your phone if you want.The only negatives are that I've had some false alerts when the wind is really whipping around my potted lemon tree (but I could fix that in the app if I was less lazy) and there have been a few times it hasn't picked up motion that was very quick (like a delivery person tossing a package on my porch). It hasn't bothered me enough to adjust any settings though. Hope that helps! I use lorex cameras for my security system since it does not have a subscription. I haven't bought the night vision cameras yet since my house has good lights around it. But the system is great and the app is easy to use to check on what the cameras detected as motion. I have wyze cameras indoor, and love them. If you are going to get one for the outdoors get the Wyze 3. Its made for outdoor environments and is a bargain of a price. Looking to get some myself soon. I also really like Eufy also. I have thier doorbell and smart lock. Love both. Not cheap, but Ubiquiti's Unifi line has a pretty slick system  slowly integrating them, but it helps that I was already using their UDMP router that has the DVR functionality built in. Wyze is a popular newer brand of smart home security devices. I‚Äôve never used their outdoor products, but they have a rather dedicated following and reasonable prices.

Actually, yes you have plenty of options. If you want the best sounding closed back wireless headphones without ANC, the $380 (on sale) Drop THX Panda is a great choice. They use planar drivers and have THX's AAA amp technology. It has LDAC for semi-lossless streaming. If you have an iPhone LDAC does not matter, it does not support it. If you don't mind open back, the HiFiMan Deva for $300 is an excellent choice. I had the drop wired version, the HE-5XX and they sounded awesome except for a slight treble distortion at high volumes. This also has LDAC. If you wanted to go cheaper, the AKG K361BT is a good option for about $100-ish. It does not have LDAC. If you needed ANC, one of the best sounding options is the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless for $350 (on sale). I'd say bowers & Wilkins. They cost more than XM4 or Bose 700, but imo are worth it.

It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt have a stove. But egriddles are like a large nonstick pan with a grease trap, so they get really dirty. Hopefully you are very good at cleaning appliances I love mine. I use it to cook pancakes, six at a time. I can do bacon on one side and fried eggs on the other, or a big mess of hashbrowns. Great for smashburgers too.I don't have a problem keeping it clean. The coating is really good at staying nonstick, I just don't use metal utensils on it at all. Wipe it down with warm water then dry.I haven't used it for grilled cheese, but it would be good for that too. Cuisinart Griddler.  It is not a one trick pony.  You can do lots of things with it and even get waffle plates for it.   I use mine for things like grilled cheese and tuna melts and waffles but it can do so much more. For me, a frying pan is more convenient than a griddle unless I'm making pancakes.  (Easier to store, easier to clean, ect.)  My mother used a griddle and an electric frying pan for all manner of meals, but she was cooking for five, so the larger surface let her do that without cooking in batches.  I suspect restaurants have them for the same reason - it lets you cook a ton of portions on one surface and cuts down on what you have to clean afterwards.  Your mileage may vary. Due to the fire hazards, I'm not allowed to operate a gas or charcoal grill on my deck at the condo where I live. I ended up buying a small Hamilton Beach electric grill (no griddle) for the occasional burgers or steaks/chicken, and it really does a great job! Grill marks are nice, grease/fat drains into a tray underneath, and it easily disassembles for cleaning. I scored it fairly cheaply (around $30 US), and I'm happy with it after a year!

It has a primary socket where you connect the TV and secondary sockets for other devices. When the TV turns on it gives power to the secondary devices, when it turns off it cuts power to them. You can find dumb ones, but I also built one using a Shelly 2.5 (you can use any multiple relay controller with power measurement on at least one output). I have a Lidl powerstrip which works fine, if you have access to Lidl I use the kasa smart strips alot, they work great, are local. The usbs are not controllable sadly[Kasa Kp303 3 outlet]( HS300 6 outlet]( you want one cheaper, I also use the gosund ones alot with local tuya, they also work great, and the usbs are controllable as a group that's the advantage to this one[Gosund/Ghome](

If it's only for ambiance, use a TV and stream the various fireplaces on YouTube, Amazon, etc. It'll look better than any janky fake fireplace.You could even build an enclosure or frame for it with a mantle. Touchstone 80036 - Sideline Elite...  got this one because i also didn't need the heat and just wanted the look.my project: can build this into anything you want.  You can use the plug wired provided or remove it and hard wire to the fireplace.  It's 0 clearance so you just frame around it and they have good instructions on how it should be framed. I went with an Amantii bespoke and put a faux mantle above it. I had someone put outlets and conduit to bookshelves behind the TV tho. I got this one:  Duraflame DFI-5010-01 Electric Infrared Quartz Fireplace Stove with 3D Flame Effect, Black  does have a heater, which I need and you don't, but I was also prioritizing the most realistic flame.

Just don't pay that absurd $300 price-I think I paid closer to half that at BJs.

If you have some way to get a wire into your end of the apartment do that. Otherwise, it's worth a try. Amazon should be pretty easy to return if it doesn't work. Sometimes they do work, sometimes they don't, really depends on how the wiring is done. If the plugs are on the same circuit, your throughput should technically be better. But if they aren't, it might not work at all, or it might be fine. I saw speeds doubled in my case when I used one. So, that was great.Edit: Wi-Fi extenders suck. I was actually recommending Ethernet over power adapters. I have a lot of experience with wireless of all varieties.  Around 17 years in total.  I am also certified with wireless technology.Extenders are 100% not worth it.  They will be reliable for 1-2 hours, if you are lucky, then they'll become problematic - and it just gets worse from there.One of the key reasons is that wireless broadcasting devices & extenders/repeaters from different companies do not work well together at all - that is very much by unspoken design.  A Netgear device will work reasonably well with another Netgear device.  A Linksys device with a Netgear device will be an endless headache with no resolution.  Netgear wants you to only buy their stuff, and Linksys only wants you to buy their stuff - so, they design their products to meet the criteria of 'wireless extenders' but not in regards to it working with another vendor.There are devices that plug into the wall sockets (powerline adapters) that will act as a 'wired' solution.  They are terrible and unreliable.  You cannot plug them into a surge protector as the ethernet traffic is seen as power fluctuations (ie. surge) and the surge protector will block/negate those signals.  Because of this, you are forced to plug them into the wall.  Any power surge or dip you get - those devices take the hit and fail.You could setup a 'mesh' network (if all of your devices support it and are from the same vendor) and those do tend to be semi-reliable, but your bandwidth is limited and any use of a microwave near or in between that wireless signal will cause the wireless to be useless as long as the microwave is in use.  This is because 'mesh' devices use 2.4GHz to communicate to each other and microwaves also use 2.4GHz.  Your device using 5GHz means nothing at this time, as the 2 'mesh' devices are not using 5GHz to talk to each other.So, if it were my situation...  Get a flat ethernet cable (Cat6 or similar) and run that cable along the walls in the corner.  The flat cables are very thin and are easy to 'hide' if you get the same color as the wall.  Ideally you'd run that flat cable directly to your PC.  If other people want to leverage it, get a small network switch (5 port or whatever is reasonable) along with a wireless access point (make sure it has Wifi5 [802.11ac aka wireless AC]).  Setup this wireless access point with the same SSID (name) and password as the device on the other side of the apartment, then run a cable from the switch to your PC.The reason for giving the wireless access point the same name & password = any device that is moving around (phone, tablet, laptop) will 'hop' from that wireless access point to the device on the other side of the apartment on their own - whichever has a better signal is the device that will be used.  And no, there is absolutely no issue with giving the wireless on 2 devices (wireless router & wireless access point) with the same info (SSID & Password).  I have done this is in professional environments with 30 wireless access points that covered 60,000sqft.

"Sorry I'm late, I had to do a firmware update on my water bottle" I've had two Spark bottles now (the original and this model) because I'm notoriously bad at staying hydrated. They work well. I like that it adjusts your water goal based on your activity and the current weather. If it's hotter and/or you're more active, it will increase your goal automatically. I tend to use it in conjunction with WaterMinder because then I can track other liquids aside from water.  As I mentioned,  being bad at drinking water, the reminders don't work all that well for me, BUT other people usually comment on why my water bottle is suddenly attempting to start a dance party with its light show which usually sparks (no pun intended) a conversation about my water bottle and I remember to take a drink. As far as quality, it keeps water cold for a while, more so than most of my other bottles so it's actually a decent bottle.  The one downside is you have to remember to charge it, and that's why it's been sitting in my house unused for a while. Have had one for a year now -- it's neat but if I ever lost or broke it, I wouldn't replace it. 80$ for a water bottle? In this economy? sheesh You can buy directly from HidrateSpark and it still works with Apple Health. They are also constantly on sale. It may seem like a silly product to some, but it actually is helpful. The glow is a reminder that you are not drinking enough water for the day. Also just a very solid water bottle. I love mine.

Probably the best bang for your buck inflatable under $500 is Body Glove Performer 11' at Costco for $399. They offer a 2-year warranty as well (gotta submit code/info on board). There are probably other boards with better/more accessories in this price range but considering the board/brand/warranty all together I think it is hard to beat.Edit: \*Under $400 since there are competitive boards under $500 like Gili Air and iRocker Nautical. iRocker Nautical is on sale for $424 and they are including a free electric pump for the next few days. Plenty of people love their irocker/isle/bodyglove/amazon boards. These are all mid-to-low range (and if you go for the cheap unknown stuff on amazon, it's going to be garbage tier) and will get you on the water, but would not be considered to be "mid range" by most standards.  Best bang for your buck typically happens around the $700 mark for the board (not a package). These boards will have better materials, construction, design, warranties, and customer support.  In the lower tier of products ($350-600) you are going to get very basic construction, materials, designs, and little-to-no warranty and customer support. One thing to be very wary of are proprietary fin systems like what iRocker/Nautical (and many off-brand amazon boards) use. It makes it significantly more difficult to get a replacement or a different fin. Also beware of brands that use shady marketing tactics like constant massive discounts and vague terms or make outstanding claims with no explanation to back it up (Tower is one that does this with every single thing they produce). Absolutely avoid anything under $350. Anything over $1100 is going to be a specialty product, or a Red Paddle Co. board (they charge a huge premium for their name, like $300 over a comparable product from an equally well-regarded brand).   If a company only makes entry-level or basic boards that's likely all they know (and chances are above zero that they are outsourcing every single bit of production including design). Look for brands that have a pedigree of high quality boards in addition to the mid-range items. There you'll find brands that are actually designing their boards, implementing different technologies, and trickling that down over the generations of their products.   Sizing:   An all-around board will be 10-11.5' long and 30-34" wide. Most people will find the sweet spot to be in the 10.5-11' x 30-32" range. For folks over about 220lb, consider getting a board in the wider end of the range 32-34." Particularly short individuals (under 5'4") would most likely benefit from a narrower board in the 30" range.  Many manufacturers will list a weight range or capacity. There is no standard for how this is determined, so be cautious, again especially with outlandish claims (looking at you tower). If a company says it's weight capacity is anything over 300/350lb and the board isn't gigantic (like 11+ feet, and 34+ inches wide, and 8+ inches thick) they are using the "this is how much weight we can put on it before it is under water" metric. Which isn't useful for most people. Most inflatables in the all-around range will work well for paddlers up to about 250lb before you start having performance and stability issues. Even on a rather large board (11x34) with a large paddler (300lb) it can be fairly difficult. I've used Tower inflatable paddleboards for years.  I have four. My favorite is the Adventurer 2.  One of them is 8 years old.  I paddle six miles daily in a saltwater bay half the year.  Bumped into everything. Figured I have over 500 miles on it this season.  It's 10'6" and 26-27 lbs.   I'm 5' tall and 145 lbs, but my son is 5'10" at 200 and we paddle on them for miles.  A good paddle also makes a difference and I invested in a Hippo Stick carbon fiber paddle.  Sometimes they're under $400. I have an iRocker Blackfin Model X and their mid-range brand iRocker Cruiser 10' 6" model and they are both fantastic. You can definitely tell the Blackfin is made with higher quality materials but we haven't had any problems out of either of the boards. I bought my Model X used for $500 and I think that was a hell of deal for that board! You may be able to find some good used boards or a good black Friday deal in the next week or so. Good luck on your search!Also, for better recommendations from others I might suggest you include a comment with your budget, where you intend to paddle (rivers, lakes, ocean, etc.) and your height and weight.

Honestly, no.. try and get a little one you can grill outside.  Maybe a local park nearby? Also interested. I have used a grill pan that was oven safe to attempt to get nice searing but it wasn't the same. I have this same problem.  No grills allowed here at my complex unless you keep it in the garage and move it out every time to cook.  No thanks.I use a George Foreman or just use the broiler in the oven (although this creates a lot of smoke)Nothing is going to give that BBQ flavor though unfortunately without an actual grill I spent most of my life in Apartments.  you cannot have a glass grill or charcoal or anything with an open flame.  but they don't say anything about an electric grill.  (Don't Ask! They will say no)  But if you go get it and quietly put it on your balcony they don't say anything.  I loved mine.  No, it is not like an outdoor gas or charcoal grill but they can work.  it takes some getting used to, to learn how to cook correctly on them.We used to have this brand and one very similar to this one. actually went through 2 of them because we grilled so much.[ couple of things I learned about cooking on these is 1) let them warm up (a lot)2) meats etc need to be at room temp to cook properly and evenly.3) It is going to take longer to cook on the electric grill.  But it will get there.You can make a small smoker pouch for your grill but be careful with that the apt. complex might freak if the smell that smoke.. Best bet is either the broiler setting and a roasting rack over a pan...or just keep a real grill on your little patio or take it outside to use it.

Vocolinc diffuser is great working with homekit. I think it works with Alexa and google also. I personally just use a smart plug with a usb power plug to spray scent into the room myself I got the  ASAKUKI Smart Wi-Fi Essential Oil Diffuser from Amazon.  &#x200B;Alexa compatible.  I‚Äôve been using the Flowerbud by VOCOlinc. I‚Äôm new to aroma therapy, but I‚Äôve really like it so far. The VOCOlinc app gives you lots of controls, including a room sensor and target humidity. I made a setup and review video here :  setup uses HomeKit, but this will work with Alexa or google.

I have two at home. Hobot and Karcher.Hobot essentially uses two rotary pads, each having a mechanism similar to a vacuum cleaner. You turn the machine on, it starts sucking air and this suction power keeps it attached to a window. Now in order to clean window, one cup is sucking air and slowly turns the whole machine, while the other cup quickly rotates the attached microfiber cloth to wipe the window.This helps remove larger items and clean most of the visible stuff, but your window will have a lot of smudges. If you can't access the window (eg. tall window, one that does not open, or even one that does that has restricted access, like sliding door in an apartment) this will help, but it is not flawless. Your windows will appear clean until sun is low enough for you to see the smudges.Karcher is somewhat opposite. It is like a hand operated vacuum cleaner with a cloth you can attach to it. So you have more control over how the window is cleaned, but requires you to have a full access to cleaned surface.I found Karcher to work better than hobot, but both have their unquestionable advantages over the other.

I avoid "smart" products whenever possible. I don't need my *bike lock* to be internet-connected and to bug me about recharging, for god's sake...  I'm sure it's lucrative for all the smart-device manufacturers, but I'd rather save thousands of dollars, stick with "dumb" products,  and keep the things in my life as simple and reliable as possible. My advice would be to get the highest-quality basic lock you can afford, and ignore the bells and whistles. (If you're very concerned about theft, buy two locks to make your bike twice as hard to steal, and be sure to learn and always use proper locking technique.) Not worth it. They spend money on flashy stuff rather than the only thing that matters, lots of really hard steel. Just more stuff to go wrong. Who is going to break a lock, steal a bike, and then take the broken lock with them? That makes no sense. IMO, it's just another thing to go wrong. KISS is my motto for most things. A lock key is very small and unobtrusive. It's bollocks. 
Some smart bike lock have advanced in ways we never imagined a decade ago. With innovative technologies and unique designs, these locks protect your bike more reliably against theft. So, here‚Äôs a list of the 11 incredibly smart bike lock to secure your bicycle while you‚Äôre on the go. . . Smart Bike Lock List: (Affiliated). . 0:00 - Introduction. . 00:24 - 11. BrightLoc.

What are you looking for ‚Äúsmart‚Äù wise? Motion sensor? Not sure if it is a true "smart trash can" but I have been using a GLAD garbage can with electronic lid for a little over a year. Just wave your hand over the lid and it opens - then a 5 second timer counts down for the lid to close. It also has a button to open without auto-close. It has 20 gallon capacity so I only have to take out the bag once every week (only 2-person family). Operates on AA batteries which I have only changed once after 10 months. Honestly, one of the best purchases I have made - not sure how I lived without it for so long. We have had 2 simple human cans, both have been excellent. We got the one that has recycling and trash in the same can.  We can use our voice to open the can.. just say   "Open can"  for hands free operation.  You can also wave your hand over it to open. There are only 2 of us in the house, so it works out pretty well.  I'd recommend getting the other simple human can that is one big trash can if you have more in your home.  We tried a few other brands that were cheaper, I think it was from best buy and hated it.  Not very responsive and loud. Sorry I can't help you but out of curiosity, what would/does a smart trashcan do?

I use Ikea Fyrtur, and I have them on every window in my flat. They're great.If installing them on a door I'd want to make sure that they were completely level and still while raising, otherwise they get snarled, but that's the only issue I'd foresee. I've got some lutron caseta ones in my home and I absolutely adore them. But they're outrageously expensive, so it's hard to recommend even though I like them a lot I have a couple Ikea Fyrtur. A bit slow sometimes but nothing too annoying. The biggest annoyance is half the time when I ask Google to close the blinds it gives me a list of blinds store in my area. I installed external motorized shades and automated them myself (relays wired to the RF remotes). Total cost $200-$400/shade depending on the size. It has been great for windows that face east/west. I have them tied to a brightness sensor, so they close when sun is directly coming through the window, but on cloudy days or if it's a cold day, they stay open. I have selectblinds.com vinyl shades on most windows (16 as I recall).  They are battery powered, and work reliably.I have the Bond hub to interface with Google Home.

I have had good results with the aerogarden bounty elite. It looks looks nice, is easy to use, and has an app to go with it. It‚Äôs currently quite expensive, but they often go on sale.Edit: if you want bigger options and don‚Äôt want to build your own system, there‚Äôs also the aerogarden farm and the Gardyn I got the 6 space one for $12 a while back. It works great. I use master blend for nutrients instead of the tablets that came with it. Only problem I had so far is if the water gets low an alarm sounds and it will shut it off if you don‚Äôt refill right away. I grow cilantro, basil,arugula, bok Choi and a small tomato variety.Do you have the little plastic covers that cover the seeds? It helps them sprout quicker. You could use something like root riot for new media but would need to be cut to size. Hi folks!I bought a couple of smart gardens today for the kids (and me).So I got the divoo 12 pot one and the indoo 7 pot.They do seem a little different and they also don't seem very smart. I think I may have been expecting more than a pump and a light haha.If anyone uses these or similar it would be epic if you could answer a couple of questions!The sponges that come with them.... Can I use any other medium that I can buy in bulk? Cotton wool? Coir?My plan is to get plants started on these then move them to the green house.Also.Are there any bigger, better, smarter alternatives.Something that maybe allows for easier water changes or even some metrics like nutrient levels etc?Also, should I buy buying a particular type of seed for these?Cheers and any help/advice is appreciated x

I don't have a specific brand, instead I recommend a type: evaporative humidifiers.tldr: cheap and easy to run with minimal maintenanceI've been through multiple ultrasonic humidifiers that work fine but maintenance is a nightmare.  Even with distilled water it turns into a petri dish within a week for me. I ended up using bleach to clean it and it would usually last two weeks.  It was disgusting.  Everything that is in the water gets atomized and sent into the air.The evaporative unit I got last winter didn't require any cleaning all winter long.  I used the recommended anti-microbial with each tank of water refill and never had an issue.  I used two wicks throughout the winter but it was unnecessary to seal when I did.Any humidifier with a tank is going to require refilling as needed.  The convenience of tap water + anti-microbial easily beats buying or making distilled water in both effort and cost.  The ultrasonic humidifiers need a fair amount of power to run non-stop.  Evaporative humidifiers just run a fan and maybe a humidity meter, making them cheaper.I recommend an evaporative unit that's designed for the size of your home/apartment (rate of water evaporation) and meets your refilling schedule (water tank size).  Beyond that there is no extra technology that goes into them, get one that looks nice or can fit somewhere out of the way. top fill is the way to go, regardless of brand. I won't even look at a humidifier that requires me to remove the tank and flip it over to fill. All 5 currently in use in our house (also have radiators) are top fill, so just fill up a pitcher and pour in as needed. Clean once a week with white vinegar and good to go. Frigidaire is my personal favorite,BTW, here's the [Amazon Link of Dehumidifiers Suggested by other Reddit Users]( here. Check out Venta. They are German made and pricey, but all parts are replaceable so it should last way longer than most.  We have the comfort plus 45 and it can maintain our 2200 sqft house. Friendly reminder that ALL Cold-mist/Ultrasonic MUST use distilled water. They can turn tap water particles (minerals, metals, pollutants) into tiny potential carcinogens if you're inhaling them on a daily/nightly basis.

It's already been mentioned but I really like my [Roadster v2]( Fairly affordable vs other bikes I was looking at and very solid. good, cheap, fast - pick any two. There are two major categories of ebikes:1. Reseller e-bikes2. 1st party e-bikesReseller e-bikes are sold by companies that source their products from China, put their brand on it, and sell them direct to consumers. There's nothing wrong with this, but you should understand what you're getting. Quality runs the gamut in this category. There are companies who source the cheapest possible products from China, using generic components all the way down to the shifters and derailleurs. But there are also companies who source quality components from the frame up. For example, my bike is a Dengfu carbon fiber frame (Dengfu is well known for their quality carbon frames) with a name brand shock, solid mid-tier fork (Rockshox Yari), brand name brakes, and tires. Only the wheel hubs and rims are generic. The rest of the bike is great quality and has held up well since 2019. Fit & finish is nice, but it's not *quite* as polished as something from the major brands. It's so close though.In the second category, you have 1st party e-bikes that are designed and manufactured under contract for large multi-national companies like Specialized, Giant, Trek, Cannondale, Scott, etc. Most sell through bike shops, but some are direct (like Diamondback and Pivot). These bikes pretty much exclusively use brand name parts from top to bottom.If you're the kind of person who has a real eye for detail, it's very easy to spot the differences between bikes at each tier. An inexpensive molded plastic or stamped steel derailleur just doesn't have the look and feel of quality that a mid-tier brand name derailleur will have. The same applies to the rest of the bike. Quality brake levers *feel* good. Quality tires provide excellent grip and will last longer than cheap tires. Quality rims and hubs are light weight and roll easily, allowing you to accelerate faster.Hitting the middle tier can be tough. There's a big price break-over point between the online brands and the bike shop brands. The major differentiator is that the bike shop brands are maintaining a dealer network. That costs money.When it comes to value, I think the reputable online resellers are a good target (in no particular order):* Luna Cycles* RadPower* Juiced Bikes* Aventon* Ride1Up* Ariel RiderEach of those resellers has a range of bikes that fit many needs. Some are more specialized than others. Which one you choose will depend on where and why you ride. Rad Bikes and Aventon fit your bill as best value. If there's a local bike shop which sells Aventon, I would go with them. Otherwise I would go with Rad Bikes because their support is better. There's a ton of places to test ride Rad Bikes, you can find them here: [ have bikes you can take off roading (fat tire with suspension). Neither have great MTB. I've been a Rad Mini owner for over two years now and am beyond happy with it.  It has fat tires and good tread and while, I haven't taken it bushwhacking or anything, it's seen its fair amount of trails and handled well off the beaten path.  As for assembly, maintenance, etc. - it did NOT come assembled and I opted to pay to have it assembled (Rad has a partnership with VeloFix, which is who I used).  I've subsequently used VeloFix any time I've needed tune-ups, service, etc. and have been happy with the service.  E-bikes are much more common these days than they were years ago and I've found that the mechanics who I've used were experienced and knew how to service an e-bike.

Opensprinker. Standalone, takes into account rain etc, and there is a plugin for Ha. I love my Rachio. It paid for itself in the first season from water savings alone. What I love even more about it is that there's a Home Assistant integration. The only downside is that the integration uses the cloud. I'm not sure if there's a protocol to control it locally. I‚Äôm happy with my rain machine.  All local control I have the bhyve orbit. It works with a HACS integration.  I like it because it was basically free with a rebate from my county.  I can control it from HA but I don't have an automations set up for it.  Not sure what I would do with it outside of the automated scheduling already built into it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I have Rachio, too, and love it. It has basic integration with HA, nothing too fancy. I mostly ‚Äúset it‚Äù via their app and ‚Äúforgot it.‚Äù
