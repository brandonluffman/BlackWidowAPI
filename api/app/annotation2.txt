Toaster oven. Amazing. I recommend [whall]( stainless steel toaster. Doesnt have million of buttons, just 3 functions (for each side), easy to clean does its job perfectly. Also not that expensive. Consider a toaster oven. Yeah, those waffles lay flat instead of vertical but my Cuisinart is going on 12+years now and doing amazing. [America's Test Kitchen]( likes the Breville in their latest roundup.Also, most toaster ovens also function similar to an air fryer with it's convection setting.I use mine to toast things all the time (bagels, waffles, bread) as well as cook, reheat and "air fry".  You'd have to pry my toaster oven from my toasted dead hands.  I haven't had a traditional toaster for 30+ years.If you really want a somewhat traditional toaster, here's what [America's Test Kitchen says about larger format toasters]( I find the Panasonic FlashXpress to be the best toaster I've ever had. Its a little pricey $100+ but it is compact and does everything. The button setup is a little different but once you get use to it, it rocks. It doesn't take up a lot of space either and is highly rated.

Popular mechanics magazine did a test on water bottles not too long ago and most bottles that are vacuum insulated work the same way and offer insulation of hot/cold for many hours. It’s more or less personal preference of lids and shape/size that could be deciding factor. One thing I will mention is my yeti gets tossed in the dishwasher daily for the last four years and still looks great. Hydro flasks are not approved for dishwasher fwiw, I tried and the outside got stained and chalky.

The Instant Pot I got off Amazon is a fantastic slow cooker and also does a bunch of other things well. best kitchen gadget. edit: there is a few models with the same name, the one I am talking about is the number 1 here: [ My wife takes 4 hours to cook a 30 minute recipe. She is pretty great otherwise. They're all pretty much the same. Just don't go too cheap (don't want one to die 4 hours into a cook a year from now or to have ridiculous heat) or too expensive (usually just includes features you don't need - like the ability to sear meat in the slow clooker in a much slower and clunkier way than using a simple pan on the stovetop).Just go for a decent mid-tier one by a popular brand (Hamilton Beach, Black and Decker, Crock Pot, etc.) and you'll likely be fine. If you can go inside a store these days, you can see if you like the settings/buttons of one over another. I'd go the route of getting a pressure cooker instead. They work as a slow cooker, rice cooker, and pressure cooker all in one. They are great for quickly cooking beans without needing to soak them first. My instant pot even has a yogurt setting
