A little surprised you churned through all that and never tried any variant of the Galaxy Buds. !thanks That's really nice, I'm sure you love the anc. I just dislike having to go into developer settings and change the LDAC codec to best quality everytime i connect them. Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch are my go to for when I'm traveling around London. The sound is pretty damn good for ¬£80. 50hr of battery life with the charging case is amazing too. Should also see how the Liberty 3 Pro line up since I did have a pair but interesting list.. the finals were something I was wondering about and this just confirmed it

Still waiting for a reasonably priced tablet with an OLED screen to replace my Tab S5e. I hate that Samsung only puts OLEDs on their most expensive models for several years now. Even if there was just something like the A8 and they slapped on an OLED for an extra $100-$150 I'd be set. To be honest I just ended up buying a pristine condition refurb tab s7. Think more people should look into refurbs. Much better value. I've used a Tab S7 almost every day since I got it boxing day 2020. I'm sure you can find them for a good price.   I haven't had an issue with it. The latest multitasking update is excellent. Article lists the A8 as "starting at $130" but fyi thats if you have an "eligible trade in" for  a $100 credit. $229 is no trade starting Xiaomi pad 5 for 350 is great, snap 760, 120hz screen 128gb.The a8 is slow af. Same for the p11, not that slow but laggy.

Yeah I'm looking too Unless you live in a small studio apartment ‚Äúbest wireless router‚Äù is an oxymoron as an all in one device like that always suffers from one compromise or another.A router does one thing and one thing only, it passes network traffic from one network to another.   Typically between your local area network and your ISPs network.   It has nothing to do with WiFi.The problem is marketing.   What you are buying at Best Buy etc is three devices in a single box.   Because of that you often end up locating it in places that‚Äôs convenient for your ISP and bad for effective connectivity to the devices you want to use on the WIFI.If you truly want the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, you purchase a separate router that fits the capacity of your ISP connection with some headroom for future upgrades, and then buy separate Wireless Access Points that can be placed where they will provide the best possible coverage of your premises.   The upgrade cycle on the router is likely going to be far less frequent than that of your WAPs. If money is not an issue then you can go with Asus GT-AX11000 or [ASUS RT-AX3000]( which is a mid-range option that offers excellent performance and features at a more affordable price point than some of the high-end routers. It's dual-band operation and MU-MIMO and AiProtection should help to improve your network's range and security. I would like to prefer Asus RT-AX86U. This is an excellent router with great speed and features. It is still giving me a very good range and performance. You can compare this router with other [best wireless routers]( along with their features.

I opt for Bose SoundLink Flex. I've heard only good things about the new released Raymate, some said it's the best bluetooth speaker they have purchased. Gonna give it a shot. You didnt even include marshall emberton 2? Is emberton overpriced?

Galaxy Watch 4, it's not even a competition. From your list, Galaxy Watch 4 is the best. Never tried anything but the Galaxy Watch 4, but I'm very happy with it. I'm not switching to anything else. It's overall badass. I wouldn't recommend to buy a Smartwatch running WearOS 2 in 2023. So a Galaxy Watch 4 is definitely the one to go with, from my point of view. I own it too and I'm pretty happy with it so far. Also Samsung has committed to provide software update for 4 years, which is pretty good in this device category.

Vivvinet and ADT come with onerous contracts, which is where they make their money.  Stay away from them.I self install Elk but that requires some skills. Honestly can't say I'd recommend any of these. Before you get locked into a costly contract for a wireless system get a quote from a local company to hard wire a system. Less maintenance (batteries), and hardwired devices are universal so if you wanted to switch companies or set up self monitoring all of the hard work is already done. Plus hardwired systems are ALWAYS faster and more reliable. Why not contact a local independent installer for a quote on a "real" security system (with supervised sensors, etc), one without a long-term monitoring contract?I much prefer the systems with the option to do hardwired contacts and using an actual main board in a metal box somewhere over the all-in-one units.

Just wanted to reply that I'm a raw denim guy, but a lot of people are going to throw out raw denim recommendations to you.  One thing to be wary of.  Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.  I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim. > * The crotch tearing (this one's a reoccurring theme)* The dye running onto white shoes (probably the cheapest pair I've had has done this)* The jeans losing their shape/fit and turning loose1. This happens when your thighs rub together and there's not enough fabric slack there. You may want to try sizing up at the thigh. Also, get a few pairs and rotate so that each pair only sees a third or a quarter of the wears instead of one pair getting it all. 2. This is called crocking, where indigo flakes off/falls off when abraded against something else. That's part of indigo, whether you're talking about jeans, jean jackets, etc. You can help remove excess dye with a wash and try a magic eraser on your shoes. 3. That's normal. The warp/weft weave will stretch out like a sweater after each wear, becoming noticeable in time. Wash them when they get too out of shape. Rag & Bone and A.P.C. are both fantastic. Sounds like you‚Äôre wearing the wrong size/cut. Try to get a good salesperson to help you with that. You may want to try shopping at someplace like Nordstrom that has good salesmen and a large selection to get the best jeans for you. With any luck you‚Äôll join us over at r/rawdenim soon! A few thoughtsCrotch tearing is usually attributed to size, if you're like me and have decent sized thighs and a small waist sizing up isn't the greatest option. I'd try a differnt cut, something with a good taper and wider thighs. Something with stretch is probably a good idea as well. High quality Jean's will likely stain shoes as well, that's normal for indigo... I second the magic eraser recommendation. As for brands theres loads of threads here on good brands you can search. Most focus on higher priced items though. So Just focusing on something you mention, in Levi's go for the premium(usually around 90) over the regular, the construction is usually much better. Speaking of jeans:  DL1961 or Naked & Famous?&#x200B;BTW, I was just SHOCKED to learn that Levi's makes $300.00 jeans now.  I never buy Levi's, so I never noticed.  I had no idea!

1. Costco has a brand of leggings called Matty M for $14. They are high waisted, opaque and matte with absolutely no shine that you usually gets with stretchy fabrics. 2. Ann Taylor Loft Ponte Petite Leggings. I managed to score about 6 of these when they were on clearance a few years ago for $14. These are ‚Äúnicer‚Äù leggings that could actually pass for pants. The Zella Live-In leggings from Nordstrom! They‚Äôre a house brand, and sometimes feature in the sales for really good deals! The high-waisted ones are especially great. A lot of the Zella leggings are actual active wear, but the live-in line is casual. Not even remotely see-through! Only complaint is that cat hair sticks to them. My go to leggings are 90 degrees by reflex. Def not see through for the first 2 years (after that much wear and washing mine are becoming see through now). You can normally find them at Marshall‚Äôs for under $20 but also have bought them online for $30 which is still worth it to me. They‚Äôre def sold as work out leggings but I don‚Äôt think they look like exercise clothing. Honorable mention: Old Navy Ponte pants - they‚Äôre legging material but with the seams they are definitely trying to be formal pants. Aerie leggings! Their PLAY leggings are thin but not see through and have a barely-there feeling when they‚Äôre on. Their MOVE leggings are thicker and more compressive, so they‚Äôre better for workouts. They also come in short, regular, and long. They‚Äôre not super pricey to begin with, but if you‚Äôre a college student you can get extra 20% off through unidays discount codes.(I‚Äôm not an advertiser just a big fan) Uniqlo is my go to for basics. Their leggings are breathable enough for casual wear and thick enough to conceal underwear and use for light sports. Absolutely love their dry ex shirts as well.

Chantelle. I‚Äôll never buy another brand again. Nordstrom's. Lots of brands to choose from, wide range of sizes, free shipping and returns online. I get all my bras from them now. If you haven‚Äôt already, I highly recommend sizing yourself using the techniques at r/abrathatfits. It was a game-changer for me.If you have a bigger chest, then Bravissimo is an awesome place to get larger sizes from a bunch of great brands. Journelle is another online shop that is lovely for more delicate, sexier pieces. My favorite combo is a Gossard Glossies bra (from Bravissimo or Journelle) with a Hanky Panky lace thong (from Journelle). It really depends on size. If you are a smaller/more standard size then you can find lots of cute stuff at places like Aerie. If you believe your bras can fit better (like if you find yourself adjusting a lot throughout the day) you should definitely check out the r/abrathatfits calculator to get sized.Personally, I love [breakoutbras.com](www.breakoutbras.com). If you are a tough fit they have a great return policy and I really communicative if you have questions about certain fits/styles. They carry a lot of big brands like Elomi and Panache (to me, Elomi is the gold standard but bras are so personally a vary a ton from person to person). Nordstrom‚Äôs is an excellent choice.  Nordstrom Rack if you are on a budget or like a bargain.  Macy‚Äôs carries Wacoal, which is a good option quality-wise.  Both stores carry cup sizes well beyond D/DD/DDD, which aren‚Äôt carried in most other stores.  Make sure you check r/abrathatfits so you know how to choose a bra that fits.Or find your local bra boutique, where you can get properly fitted by someone who knows what they are doing.Not Victoria‚Äôs Secret.  Because you can do much better.  Much, much better.  And in my experience their staff members do not know how to properly fit bras, and if you are outside of their size range will try to sell you one of their bras even though they do not fit you properly.

Patagonia Barely. I like the Barely hipsters, but they come in a brief and a thong version too. The Patagonia Active are also good. I don't know what magic they crafted this fabric with but these are seriously some amazing underwear. Not only are the the most comfortable I have ever worn, but they also dry fast, and are crazy durable. I have pairs that are ten years old and still look new. The only way I can tell them apart is that a couple are different colours and they sometimes change the designs on the fabric a little bit. It took a while, but I replaced my entire drawer. They biggest downside is that they are $24 CDN a pair and it is rare to find sales. At this point I would settle for a pair that just fits. I have at least 40 categories of panties‚Ä¶none of which are BIFL  Patagonia! I love love love their underwear and I‚Äôm slowly replacing all of my pairs with theirs.

I actually really like the nike running shorts, I get the 7" and cut out the inner liner, they're like $20 each pretty frequently Outlier and Patagonia come to mind, possibly Huckberry Champion shorts from target. They sit above the knee, are thin/breathable, and are cheap. I actually love Lulu lemon for shorts.  Check out [these rugby shorts]( 5" inseam, pockets, and they're on sale now for $10. I have three pairs that I wear for CrossFit and they're great.
