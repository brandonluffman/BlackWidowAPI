If you’re looking for the best headphones on the market, it’s tough to get a straight answer. What works for some people doesn’t work for others, and few product categories are as diverse as headphones. In-ears, on-ears, over-ears—there’s just so much to choose from, and it’s hard to tell what’s right for you. Editor’s note: This list was updated on March 10, 2023 to include the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless as a top pick, and the Beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X, Google Pixel Buds A-Series, Grado SR80x, Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, Sennheiser HD 660S2, and Shure SE215 in the Notable mentions, add isolation and frequency response charts for the AKG K371, and to update formatting. For our top five picks, you can find the isolation and frequency response charts at the end of each image gallery. You can learn more about how to read our charts here. Why is the Sony WH-1000XM5 the best pair of noise cancelling headphones? Now that Sony has released the Sony WH-1000XM5, it takes the crown as the best active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones. This new model outperforms its closest competitors in noise attenuation and microphone quality. The default frequency response is a bit bassier than what we typically recommend, but you can easily equalize this from the Sony Headphones Connect app (iOS/Android) or your preferred third-party equalizer. To see frequency response and isolation charts for any of our top picks, scroll to the end of each photo gallery. The WH-1000XM5 offers top-of-the-line specs and features, including a custom equalizer, Sony’s 360 Reality Audio, and auto-pause/play sensors. The Sony WH-1000MX5 includes speak-to-chat, which pauses your media when you are speaking to someone and resumes playback 30 seconds after so you don’t miss the person’s response. You also have Bluetooth multipoint which is a great productivity feature for those who like to keep an ear on their phone while connected to their laptop. The microphone system is among the best we’ve seen in a headset like this and cancels out background noise effectively no matter the conditions. Take a listen to two of our microphone demos below! Sony WH-1000XM5 mic demo (Ideal): Sony WH-1000XM5 mic demo (Wind): If the price tag of the WH-1000XM5 is just a bit too high, you also can’t go wrong with the older Sony WH-1000XM4, which was previously our pick for best noise cancelling headphones. When comparing the Sony WH-1000XM5 to the WH-1000XM4, it’s clear that these headphones are closely related. Even though the XM5 model has better ANC and sound quality to boot, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is still worth getting if you don’t want to spend as much money. The fourth-generation headset shares many of the premium features found on the WH-1000XM5 and you can expect the older model to go on sale. If you want a budget alternative, the Sony WH-XB910N is a solid ANC headset if you can find it. However, you’ll only save $100, as the price tag is most often around $250. The fact of the matter is that good ANC is tough to get at a good price, and Sony currently has the best. The Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is the best set of wireless earbuds for iPhone owners True wireless earphones took the market by storm after being dominated by the Apple AirPods for so long. Now there’s plenty of competition, much of which offers a more compelling experience than most of Apple’s audio products. However, with the company’s latest release, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) is back on top of the pole for iOS users. These buds offer great ANC, sound quality to match, and sound better than the AirPods (3rd generation) simply by virtue of the fact that they can seal your ear canal. These earbuds bring a big improvement to ANC and battery life, and the retain the same IPX4 rating, which now also covers the charging case. Speaking of the charging case, that’s where a lot of the more notable changes come. The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) charging case features Apple’s new U1 chip, which makes it compatible with Apple’s Find My service and the new integrated speakers will emit a noise to help you find it. Much like all the other AirPods, this is best used with Apple devices. It only supports SBC and AAC Bluetooth codecs, so there’s no high quality codec for android users. Also, many of the earbuds software features are found in the iOS settings app, so you’ll miss out on other platforms in that respect too. Still, this is about as good as it gets for wireless earbuds for Apple users. The AirPods Pro mic sounds best in quiet environments but can filter out some background noise. Listen to our samples below. AirPods Pro (2nd generation) microphone demo (Ideal): AirPods Pro (2nd generation) microphone demo (Office): AirPods Pro (2nd generation) microphone demo (Street): How does the microphone sound to you? Don’t lose pace with the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Sennheiser combines most of what you want in a great set of over-ear Bluetooth headphones in the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. With support for a variety of high quality codecs like AAC, aptX, aptX HD, and aptX Adaptive, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C listening, you’ll hardly ever get caught without a connection. You even get Bluetooth multipoint. More to the point, a stellar 56 hours and 21 minutes of battery life (with ANC on) outperforms most headphones. While the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless doesn’t beat out the Sony WH-1000XM5 on noise cancelling, the ANC onboard is still rather effective and adjustable. That sound experts at Sennheiser tune the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless to sound frankly great, is unsurprising. It gets very close to our target curve with just a bit more bass. However, if that sound is not your preference, you can utilize the Smart Control app to adjust EQ. In addition you can create automatic listening settings for different locations and adjust ANC. The touch controls are intuitive, and little luxuries like on-ear detection contribute to the overall flagship worthy experience of the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless. That you get a carry case and an airplane adapter means you don’t have to shell out for accessories either. Plus, the Sennheiser cans undercut the price of most premium headphones without significant compromises. Sennheiser does a pretty good job with the MOMENTUM 4 Wireless, although, it has some issues with noise rejection, but nothing unusual for headphones without booms. Take a listen to the following demo recordings. Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless microphone demo (Ideal conditions): Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless microphone demo (Wind conditions): Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless microphone demo (Street conditions): How does the microphone sound to you? Can’t go wrong with the new “old standby” AKG 371 Though people have been picking the Sony MDR-7506 for decades, a true successor in the “budget monitor headphone” category has finally taken center stage. The AKG K371 offers a really good baseline for what constitutes good sound in the consumer market. That’s not because these are super bassy, or that they’re flashy—if anything they’re the opposite of both. This pair of headphones sounds excellent for what it is, and provides a really good double-life as a dependable studio monitor. Sure, these are a set of wired cans with a rather cumbersome cable. But if you’re listening at home, mixing a track, or working at the coffee shop: these are the headphones you want. The HiFiMan Sundara is an excellent pair of high-end headphones Sure, you could spend thousands of dollars on headphones that may or may not sound better, but the HiFiMan Sundara is at the perfect crossroads between affordability and top-tier performance. Sure, that sounds a little weird to say for a set of $300 USD planar magnetic headphones, but our testing shows the Sundara does an excellent job at providing listeners with good sound quality when compared to its closest competitors. However, many headphones in this bracket are very heavy and uncomfortable, and the Sundara has this issue to an extent. However, the choice to use cloth in the padding of the ear cups and the form-fitting band do a lot to make this product far more comfortable to use for those who wear eyeglasses. If you don’t wear eyeglasses, all the better. Of course, as open-back headphones, these let in just about every sound around you. So be sure to note that before you start spending like crazy. Additionally, if you’d like to equalize these headphones any: you’re probably going to want an amplifier of some sort to avoid volume issues. Why should you consider the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700? While the ANC on the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 may not be as impressive as the company’s Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones, Bose has shown commitment to users by improving the ANC with a comprehensive firmware updates (version 1.8.2). You can view the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 ANC chart. We also like the NCH 700 for its sleek design and seemingly perfect touch controls. Many companies make calibrate their headsets’ touch panels to be too sensitive, resulting in many misfires, but Bose’s headset is a breeze to operate. The default frequency response (chart) is excellent and requires little fixing, but you can change it directly from the Bose Music app (iOS/Android) if you’d like. Those with unusually low voices may sound a bit “off” or “hollow” to those on the other end but this is to mitigate the proximity effect. For the most part, the NCH 700 microphone is quite good in all contexts since it filters out quite a bit of environmental noise. Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 microphone demo (Ideal): Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 microphone demo (Street): Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 microphone demo (Wind): How does the microphone sound to you? Audiophiles should consider the Drop x Sennheiser HD 6XX If you’re looking for the absolute best way to spend money on headphones for the computer, Drop’s partnership with Sennheiser brought a legendary audiophile option—the HD 650—down to roughly half the original asking price with the HD 6XX. Budget-conscious audiophiles would be doing themselves a disservice by not giving these a spin. There are a few minor differences between the HD 6XX and the HD 650 ($304.78 at Amazon), but most are cosmetic in nature. The performance of the HD 6XX is top-notch, and is much lighter than it looks. If you’re the kind of listener who spends a lot of time at the computer, this is the kind of headphones you should be looking for. Just be aware that the open back is a double-edged sword: it allows for better sound quality and clarity, but it also lets in all the outside noise around you. The best headphones: Notable mentions We can’t highlight every headset the way we’d like, so instead, we’ve put together a bulleted list of alternative standouts that didn’t quite make the best headphones cut. Apple AirPods Max: iPhone owners who want something beefier than the AirPods Pro for international flights should invest in the AirPods Max. We do mean invest: this set of headphones goes for $479.99 at Amazon but occasionally goes on promotion for less. This has some of the best ANC we’ve seen and excellent sound quality. If you have an iPhone you can take advantage of the headset’s H1 chips for hands-free Siri access, automatic device switching, Adaptive EQ, and more. Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2: Enthusiasts sing the praises of the original ATH-50x for its rugged build and reliable performance. The second-generation Bluetooth version carries over everything we love about the tried-and-true wired model with LDAC support and excellent battery life for $199 at Amazon. At under $200 USD, this is a solid headset. Beyerdynamic DT 900 PRO X: If wired is your sole interest with a studio style frequency response, this is a great pick. The open back design wears comfortably, it gets very close to our ideal sound without reaching astronomical pricing ($249 at Amazon). Its closed back companion, the DT 700 PRO X, has less treble on tap and is another great choice. Bose QuietComfort 35 II: Yes, this headset is from 2017, but it still holds up today. The ANC keeps pace with some of the best headsets on the market, and comfort remains bar none. If you don’t care for the most premium hardware (e.g., USB-C charging) save some coin and get the QC 35 II instead of the QC 45. Grado SR80x: If you can’t shell out for top of the line open back headphones, these unique Brooklyn built on-ear headphones (for $125 at Amazon) are comfortable with repairable parts and a more trebly frequency response. Sennheiser HD 660S2: Certainly not the cheapest of the wired open back headphones on our list ($599.95 at Amazon), this set offers a very pleasant and analytical frequency response. Like most open back designs, it’s not for bass heads. If you find its predecessor, the HD 660S, for less cash it is equally good. The Sennheiser HD 600 is also a tried and true choice in the same style with replaceable parts. Hold up! Something’s different: Some of our picks’ frequency response and isolation charts were measured with our old testing system. We have since purchased a Bruel & Kjaer 5128 test fixture (and the appropriate support equipment) to update our testing and data collection. It will take a while to update our backlog of old test results, but we will update this article (and many others!) once we’re able with improved sound quality measurements and isolation performance plots. These will be made obvious with our new chart aesthetic (black background instead of white). Thank you for bearing with us, and we hope to see you again once we’ve sorted everything out. If you want more portable options, check out these earbuds Bose QuietComfort Earbuds: In typical Bose fashion, the QC Earbuds has excellent sound quality to boot and some of the best ANC around, save for the WF-1000XM4 from Sony. These earbuds are pretty bulky, as is the case, but they still fit comfortably because of the StayHear Max ear tips. You can pick it up for $139.3 at Amazon. Due to the tuning of the updated QuietComfort Earbuds II, we still prefer the originals. Google Pixel Buds A-Series: For the Android user seeking a good set of earbuds with Google Assistant integration can get these for $93.02 at Amazon. Those looking for ANC and some extra luxuries like spatial audio should check out the Google Pixel Buds Pro. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: This is a truly great pair of wireless earbuds with solid sound and features like direct Spotify for easy listening. You get excellent ANC and 360 Audio too. Pick your favorite colorway for $189.99 at Amazon. Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3: This is among the best wireless ANC earbuds you can buy and it has a premium design with an IPX4 rating. The Smart Control app lets you adjust the sound quality and you can find a very secure fit with the included ear and wing tips. The main downside, like many premium wireless earbuds, is the price ($199.95 at Amazon). Shure SE215: If you can forego true wireless for strictly wired earbuds, this set balances great sound, comfort, and Shure’s industry renowned reliability for only $99 at Amazon. Sony WF-1000XM4: These premium priced ($178 at Amazon) wireless earbuds have active noise cancelling, a decent microphone, and best of all sound excellent. Their battery life isn’t the best, but they offer quick charging to make up for it. These earbuds support SBC, AAC, and LDAC. When you download the Sony Headphones Connect app you can EQ the sound signature and enable adaptive sound control. What you should know about the best headphones Calling something “the best” at anything is controversial at best, so we create our best lists with the caveat that your experiences may vary from our own. Sometimes people have a unique set of needs, and that can’t be satisfied by going to a list of “best headphones” because the article doesn’t address what the best headphones out there are… for you. Consequently, we encourage all of our readers to write down all the things they want out of their headphones first—before rolling the dice on a pick. This list has a lot of all-time greats, but if you need something a little bit more tailored to your needs, definitely keep reading our other lists and features to arm yourself with enough knowledge to make the right purchase. Think hard about what types of headphones you like (in ears? over ears? on ears?), and also try to figure out what features you need. Maybe you need to go to the store to see how they fit on your head? Do you wear glasses or have ear piercings? Maybe you should look into getting velour pads instead of leather! These are all things covered in our reviews and other best lists. Are wired headphones better than Bluetooth headphones? This list has a few wired options if you want great sound, but we also have a few wireless options if you prefer convenience. If you opt for a Bluetooth pair, there are a few things you should know. First and foremost, the rumors you’ve heard are true. Bluetooth just can’t party with wired headphones, at least as it pertains to sound quality. Even some of the best codecs available aren’t as great as they seem at first glance. AAC is basically only good if you’re on an iOS device which means Android users should probably stick to aptX, and LDAC isn’t truly hi-res. The good news is that you most likely can’t hear any of the details in the data that’s being dropped, but it’s still not a great selling point. Of course, if you do think that you have superhuman hearing feel free to test yourself with our simple hearing test. There is hope, though: Bluetooth SIG announced LE Audio and the LC3 codec, an efficient alternative to SBC. We’re excited to see the benefits to the hard-of-hearing community play out in the real world, and know that LC3 will provide a 50% increase in audio quality relative to SBC. What’s more, headphone stutters will be lessened as packet-loss-management is improved, so instead of hearing annoying, intermittent drops, the dropout process will be much smoother. Even the best headphones will benefit from the new codec. We mentioned codecs in the last section, but what exactly is a Bluetooth codec? If Bluetooth is the technology that enables two devices to communicate with each other, then codecs can be thought of as the language that they speak. When two devices speak the same language, they can communicate faster and send more data between each other which results in better sound quality. Some of the best codecs have high transfer rates if both devices are compatible, and if they aren’t then everything just reverts down to the basic codec called SBC. Unfortunately, codecs can be a bit finicky and as we mentioned before don’t always work the way they’re intended to which is why wired headphones usually sound better. Though it is worth mentioning that Qualcomm’s aptX adaptive that seems promising, but we’ll have to wait to test it ourselves before we get our hopes up. How does active noise cancelling work? If you were wondering how active noise cancellation works, don’t worry you’re not alone. There’s a lot that goes into it and some companies like Bose and Sony have their own ways of achieving it technologically, but it all comes down to basic physics. Active noise cancelling is actually something called destructive interference. If you take one wave with an amplitude of +1 and combine it with another wave that has an amplitude of -1, you’re left with zero. Active noise cancelling headphones take advantage of this by using tiny microphones to hear what sounds are around you and then creating an opposite sound wave to cancel that before it reaches your ears. Of course, this isn’t perfect and works better for long, droning sounds then sudden, screeching ones. So don’t expect ANC headphones to block out that crying baby on your next flight. But when you combine noise cancelling technology with good isolation, you can get pretty close to completely blocking the outside world. This is harder to achieve when it comes to earbuds, as they don’t completely cover your ear. So instead, a solid pair of memory foam ear tips might be worth looking into as they do a better job at isolating sound than the silicone ones that come with most buds. How we choose the best headphones If you’d seen this list before, you’ll probably notice that it’s completely different than it was in years past. Now it’s a perpetually updated piece. Gone is the Sennheiser HD 800, and the rest of the exorbitantly expensive headphones. That’s because we realized that what’s “best” objectively, isn’t what’s “best” for everyone… so our selections needed a bit of tweaking. Just like it is with power tools and kitchen utensils, different headphones are built for different purposes. Using the right tool for the job is important, and ensures that you get the best experience possible. You wouldn’t use a chainsaw to cut butter any more than you’d use a set of AKG K7XX on an airplane. In that light, we took extra time to take into account how most people actually use headphones. What makes a good pair of gym headphones? What makes a good pair of wireless earbuds? What’s the good in having a best headphones list that doesn’t help most people buy headphones they like? While we took the time to highlight some Bluetooth headphones, active noise cancelers, and open-backed cans—be sure to read the descriptions to see if they’re right for you. Many people want a set of headphones that will do everything, but those models are few and far between. That’s why our winner isn’t a set of headphones you’d see on other outlets’ top 10. It’s more about what people actually want than what’s objectively the best performing set out there. While many might be upset that we chose more consumer-geared models than the stunning halo products of audiophile lore: it’s important to us that our readers aren’t dissatisfied with their headphones. To that end, we find that the ultra-expensive headphones are generally a poor fit for most, often leaving your average consumer frustrated and feeling like they wasted a lot of money. Those with a more developed idea of what kind of headphones they want should also check out our other best lists. Not every best headphone model listed here will meet all of your needs. With that being said, all of our picks were used by at least one team member, and all of these picks sound fantastic. Because our ad-free business model relies on you enjoying your headphones without returning them, this list represents what we earnestly feel is the most deserving of your money. We knew that we wanted to create a list of financially attainable headphones that meet realistic use cases, rather a drool-inducing, unrealistic list for your average consumer. Why you should trust SoundGuys on the best headphones In short, you should trust us because we show our work, strive to provide as much unimpeachable information to you, and pin our revenue model on the happiness of our readers with our recommendations. If you return the product we suggest, we don’t see a dime. When it comes to audio, the SoundGuys team has years of experience reviewing products between them (and even more listening to them). Chris spent years reviewing audio products, among other things, at publications such as USA Today and Reviewed.com, Lily clocked in countless hours at radio stations and reviewing products independently before joining our team, and Adam has been listening to headphones and speakers for nearly five years as part of SoundGuys. So needless to say, if a product makes best headphones list it’s because we were genuinely impressed by them and had some hands-on experience with them (or at the very least put in hours of research). Frequently asked questions about the best headphones I wish I could give you a definitive answer of one perfect pair of wireless headphones, but truthfully, the answer to this question depends on your personal preferences. Do you want really good active noise cancelling? Go for the Apple AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM5. Are you looking for great wireless sound quality and don’t want to spend a fortune? Check out the Audio-Technica AT-M50xBT2. Is long battery life important to you? Try the Anker Soundcore Space Q45. There are a lot of good headphones out there, and we do our best to outline all the objective facts and describe our subjective experiences with each product so you can make an informed decision based on your personal priorities. The Apple AirPods Max are bound to be a fine pair of headphones for any iPhone user, but the noise cancelling headset is extremely cost-prohibitive. It affords a lot to the right listener, though. Each ear cup houses Apple’s H1 chip for extensive processing power so the headset can deftly perform tasks like hybrid ANC, passthrough audio, hands-free Siri access, Spatial Audio, and more. If you have multiple Apple devices all synced up to the same iCloud account, you’ll enjoy automatic device switching. The Sony WH-1000XM4 feature several upgrades from the Sony WH-1000XM3 including improved noise cancelling, Bluetooth multipoint, and speak to chat functionality. That being said, the WH-1000XM3 is still an excellent pair of headphones, if outdated compared the even newer, WH-1000XM5.\", \"title\": \"Best headphones of 2023 - SoundGuys\", \"favicon\": \"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAAAZlBMVEX////+/v7K1uNxkrR4mLj4+fv+/v9qjbH8/f37/P3v8/YmWY2OqMOBnr1VfKWiuM7P2ubk6vE5Z5dNd6KpvdJghauHo8DV3+mascoPR4EAO3nq7/QnWo4EP3u3x9kALG5GcJ2+zdzEjqfiAAAAn0lEQVR4AT3MxQHDQBDAQJkuuwdmZvdfZDiZl17iI4qTNMPwZ+CWEvElimKdRwGyLAIwhJx3FSVVqJu26vpiQGCM/TRPc5O4fikyYFhdmLZ5ty4MpQXCcaPsd6E5fUsE+xFQMFR13WJAfIWqslTVpYBS9AjKGF8lAhj8K6paL48AYL0xQ32yuPcDoW2aLgTYu4E3XYZi3FF+IiIZFxCFB02QCPOdzlqCAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\"}, {\"link\": \"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-headphones-1280340\", \"text\": \"The best tech tutorials and in-depth reviews Try a single issue or save on a subscription Issues delivered straight to your door or device More VersusAppliancesAudiovisualCamerasCar TechComputingCouponsDownloadsEntertainmentFitnessLaptopsPhonesSmart HomeTabletsTVsWearablesAbout Us When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The best headphones 2023: top cans from Sony, Bose and more The absolute best headphones in every style, for every budget Yes, there are newer models available, but we still rate the Sony WH-1000XM4 as the best headphones for most people when balancing performance and price. The audio quality is rich and exuberant, the noise cancellation is strong, they work wired or wireless, and they offer great battery life. For some very affordable earbuds that offer excellent audio quality, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus remain among our favorites – they're just an incredible price these days. Matt Bolton, Managing Editor – Entertainment The best headphones are a must if you love listening to music, podcasts and movies. They’re essential if you travel regularly, have a lot of video calls, need music to focus while you’re working or to keep you motivated while you’re working out. There are many different types of headphones out there, and new ones are launched every week, which means finding the best headphones or the best earbuds for you isn’t easy. You have to consider several factors, including your budget, the features you need and any preferences you have about how they look and fit. For sheer sound quality you can't beat a good pair of wired headphones. But if you want the convenience of cable-free listening there are some excellent unwired options too. In fact, there are so many that we've put together two separate guides: one for the best wireless headphones and one for the best true wireless earbuds. We've also put together a guide to the best noise-cancelling headphones. They're particularly good for travelling or for drowning out the ambient noise of open-plan offices. If you're on a tight budget, though, some of the best over-ear headphones' ear cups do a pretty good job of cutting out ambient noise without any technological trickery. We've spent many happy hours testing the best earbuds and headphones over the years and over our ears, and we know exactly what makes a great pair of cans or buds: sound quality, of course, but also comfort and convenience. And you don't necessarily need to spend huge sums of money to get all three of those things, as this guide demonstrates. There's a huge variety of headphones and earbuds here, but they share important features that make them easy to recommend. Those features include comfortable design, class-leading audio performance, and useful extra features such as built-in voice assistants or rock-solid wireless connectivity. Whether you want to listen with your smartphone, laptop, or one of the best MP3 players, you won't be disappointed with any of these pairs – but if you're looking for gaming headphones with built-in mics, we'd suggest checking out our best PC gaming headset guide, as that's laser-focused on gaming performance, surround sound and in-game chat. The best headphones 2023: our picks The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones deliver excellent noise-cancellation and sound quality in a design that we found comfortable and lightweight throughout our testing. They don’t look different from their predecessors, the Sony WH-1000XM3. However, new features, including multipoint pairing, DSEE Extreme upscaling, conversational awareness and auto-play/pause using a built-in sensor, mean they’re a significant upgrade. The WH-1000XM4 headphones also support Sony’s 360 Reality Audio format, which delivers spatial audio on stereo headphones, plus the LDAC codec that can send a bitrate of up to 990 kbps. However, it no longer supports aptX or aptX HD, so your hi-res audio support mileage may vary. There are a wonderful pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones and deliver exactly what they promise and then some thanks to their exceptional noise cancellation and cutting-edge codec support. Read our full Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones review 2. Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus Now that they've received a permanent price cut, dragging that tag down to more than half its original price, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus are a much more appealing option than ever. Not that they weren't already at their original cost, receiving the coveted five-star rating in our review. A clear upgrade from its predecessors, these offering excellent audio performance, a helpful app, and easy-to-use controls. In terms of audio quality, we found during testing that they offer tons of dynamism and character, with a lively presentation, high accuracy, and a lot of detail. And, while there's no noise cancellation on offer, the sound isolation is very good. Finally, if you're ok with using them in low power mode, you should get up to nine hours of battery life per earbuds charge (up to 45 hours with the case). Read our full Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus review 3. Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless We said under intense review that Sennheiser's welcome update to its 2019 Sennheiser Momentum third-generation Wireless headphones would soon be sitting pretty within this buying guide, and here they are. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are the newest August 2022-issue wireless over-ear headphones from Sennheiser and if Sony (listed above and below) isn't worried, it should be. These cans boast an incredible 60-hour battery life, a likeable app, an extensive feature set, easy on-ear controls, talented adaptive noise cancellation and a zealous sound that'll have you nodding your head happily wherever you go. Yes, they're a tad plain aesthetically, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and these headphones sound outrageously good for the level. Sennheiser has packed everything and the kitchen sink into the Momentum 4 Wireless’s spec sheet, including Sidetone to better hear your voice during calls and 'Sound Zones', EQ and ANC presets which can be set to magically kick in when you're, well, in the zone. Make no mistake though, the headline-grabber is still the sound. And what a sound it is! Think open, detailed, expansive, neutral and crisp. Never is it overly warm; never is it congested or muddied through the bass. Move over Sony XM5, there's a new set of cans in town and honestly, they're just that little bit better across the board. Oh, also, they're a little cheaper than the XM5… Read our full Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless review These new Sonys would be at the top of our table if it weren't for the fact that right now the outgoing model, the WH-1000XM4, is substantially cheaper and does almost everything the newer Sonys do. These are better headphones, but at the moment the XM4s are the better buy. In our Sony WH-1000XM5 review we said that the XM5s are \\\"the best headphones in the world thanks to their class-leading noise-cancelling features and well-balanced audio\\\". However, \\\"a steeper price point and similar functionality to earlier models make the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones an ever-so-slightly tougher sell than before.\\\" The new design is more elegant and contains slightly smaller drivers than before, and while there's less wind distortion the trade-off is that they don't fold neatly like the previous model did. The noise cancelling is best-in-class, doing an excellent job of muting the higher pitched sounds that ANC headphones tend to find challenging, and sound quality is exemplary. Your co-workers or fellow commuters won't take a dislike to you either: these headphones don't leak as badly as some over-ears do. The other headline feature here is battery life, which is now 10 hours longer: expect up to 40 hours with the ANC off and 30 with it on. If you don't already have noise cancelling headphones, these are as good as it currently gets – but the older, cheaper model is almost as good and better value as a result.

Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds With the Sony WF-1000XM4s, Sony has combined performance, ergonomics, and build quality more effectively than ever before in a noise-cancelling true wireless package. During our testing we found that compared to their predecessors, the Sony WF-1000XM3, the newer wireless earbuds offer enough quality-of-life features to make them worth upgrading to, even if they are a little more expensive. Features like auto-pause and being able to tune the buds to the shape of your ears are truly useful. While other true wireless earbuds surpass the Sony WF-1000XM4 in particular areas – in terms of noise cancellation, for example – no other model comes close to offering such excellent quality across the board. That’s why the Sony WF-1000XM4 are hands-down the best true wireless earbuds you can buy today. Read our full Sony WF-1000XM4 review 6. Apple AirPods Pro 2 The Apple AirPods Pro 2 offer improved audio performance over the original AirPods Pro and fantastic ANC in a comfortable, true wireless form factor. The Pro 2 buds are a step up from the original AirPods Pro. Design changes might be subtle, but audio performance is upgraded with new drivers and amplifiers. During our testing, we rated the sound from the Pro 2 as brilliant—there’s rich audio across genres and a wide and expansive soundstage. ANC is also greatly improved and performs exceptionally well, we found it blocked out most external noises. Transparency mode is more useful too. It's adaptive, allowing you to have natural conversations when you don’t want to take them out. Battery life has been boosted to 6 hours from the buds with ANC on, and 30 hours from the charging case, which is now IPX4 water resistant—withstanding light showers and sweating—and has a speaker, handy if you lose them as you can activate a 'Find My' request. We still rate the original AirPods Pro, but the Pro 2 are one of our favorite options if you're looking for a pair of the best headphones in a true wireless design. If you want the comfort of over-ear headphones, there are better headphones on this list, like the Sony WH-1000XM4s at the top. But the AirPods Pro 2 prove you don't necessarily need an over-ear design anymore for truly immersive sound and excellent ANC from your headphones. Read our full Apple AirPods Pro 2 review 7. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Samsung has truly turned a corner with its latest Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, which forego futuristic looks in favor of great 24-bit sound, head-tracked spatial audio and a design that fits comfortably. Apple, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser and in fact all of the best wireless earbuds manufacturers now need to take a good look at what Samsung has done with the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. They're good. No, really, they're good. These smaller, more comfortable and less arrogant earbuds (remember the rose gold, kidney-bean shaped Galaxy Buds Live? These are nothing like those) are packed full of useful perks such as excellent ANC, voice detect, wearer detection and customizable on-ear controls – all of which work very well indeed – plus IPX7 water ingress protection. But the headline-grabber, if you own a Samsung Galaxy device (and thus, access to the Samsung Wearable companion app and home-screen widget) is 360 audio with optional head-tracking, thus allowing you to use your phone as the focal point to direct more of that new end-to-end 24-bit high-res audio to whichever ear you prefer. Read our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review 8. 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphone After testing the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones for a few weeks, we're certain that they deliver fantastic sound and equally fantastic value for money. That's why we consider them to be the best headphones for those who prefer wired earbuds. For $100 / £100 (about AU$168), it’s hard to find a better-sounding and more well-built pair of earphones than the 1MORE Triple Drivers – although if you want a little extra refinement and more luxurious materials, the same firm's 1MORE Quad Drivers are even more impressive, albeit at twice the price. But at this price, and with such excellent build and design, it’s hard to fault the Triple Drivers. The inbuilt remote feels a little cheap, but that's more than made up for by the lush sound quality offered by these luxe-looking earbuds. For the price, you can't do better than 1MORE's Triple Driver in-ear headphones. Read our full 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphone review The SoundMagic E11BTs are an extremely capable pair of wireless in-ear earphones, and given their low price, it really is difficult to fault them. The audio quality on offer here is fantastic with vocals sounding clear and smooth, while a hefty amount of bass helps elsewhere. Treble frequencies are sharp and crystal-clear too with a good level of attack. Although we also found that they might be a little harsh for anyone who wants to have a very warm soundstage. We found these headphones comfortable to wear thanks to their ergonomically designed eartips, and we thought they looked elegant too. They're attached to a flat neckband that didn't irritate our skin while running or working out. They have an IPX4 rating, which means they should withstand sweaty sessions, so they're a solid option as a spare pair of workout earbuds. Read our full SoundMagic E11BT review 10. Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 When we first reviewed the original Lypertek PurePlay Z3 true wireless earbuds (then known as the Lypertek Tevi), we were blown away. The Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 true wireless earbuds are their successors. They’re similar to the originals, include a few key improvements, and are available at the same affordable price point of $99 / £99. That price gets you everything we loved about the original PurePlay Z3, including detailed balanced sound, a whopping 80 hours total battery life from its petite USB-C charging case, and a comfortably fitting bud with physical buttons. But the Z3 2.0 earbuds also add wireless charging, a powerful new LDX Audio mode, improved app functionality and a hear-through ambient mode. The bad news is that we found the app connectivity to be patchy, and the ambient hear through mode isn't a patch on what you get from the likes of Sony’s noise cancelling WF-1000XM4. The hear-through mode is a shame, then, but these remain very impressive earbuds in terms of sound quality, stamina and affordability. They're more than a match for headphones two or three times the price. Read our full Lypertek PurePlay Z3 2.0 review 11. Bowers & Wilkins PX8 Sonically, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are now the wireless over-ear headphones to beat. There, we said it. If that's all you need to hear, thank you for reading this particular buying guide. But if you want to know why we said \\\"sonically\\\" rather than \\\"across the board\\\", and why we gave them four-and-a-half stars rather than the full five, read on. The simple fact is that the B&W PX8 are expensive. There are good, tangible, understandable reasons for this – a new carbon cone 40mm drive unit replaces the bio-cellulose driver in the more affordable Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 and the die-cast aluminum arms, diamond-cut bright metal detailing and Nappa leather trim elevates the build to high-end territory – but for some, anything priced hotter than the AirPods Max is too rich for the blood given the current financial climate. We hear you. But we have also heard the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones and, cost of living crisis or no, they're exceptional. Read our full Bowers & Wilkins PX8 review 12. Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 If the Sony WH-1000XM4s are the current king of noise-cancelling headphones, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are next in line for the throne. We think the Sonys sound slightly better, but the Bose noise cancelling is superior – so if you're a frequent flyer these may well be the better option for you. By applying noise cancellation to phone calls as well as music, Bose has made great strides in the field of noise-cancelling headphones. We found the sound quality to be undeniably good, with a vibrant, lively character and well-balanced soundstage. If you’re trying to decide between buying the Sony WH-1000XM4s and these Bose headphones, we’d recommend going for the former because of that lower price and better battery life – they're our number one pick for those reasons. But you wouldn’t be making a mistake if you opted for the Bose cans instead (and we wouldn’t blame you if you did) – they sound great, look stunning, and the noise cancellation is out of this world. Read our full Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review 13. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds This is Bose’s second attempt at a set of true wireless headphones, and the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are leaps and bounds better than the older SoundSport Free. The design of these earbuds much improved and the noise cancellation is also exemplary. There are ten levels of ANC on offer here. At maximum, you’re practically cut off from the rest of the world, encased in a cocoon of sound that’s made entirely of your favourite tunes. You’ll only be able to hear some of the highest frequency sounds such as sirens, and even they’re muted to a large degree. The Bose headphones aren't quite as bassy as Sony's rivals, but we enjoyed their superb clarity and consistently impressive sound quality. During our testing, we found these noise-cancelling earbuds incredibly comfortable and well balanced, too, and while we expected their bulky form factor to be an issue they're much more comfortable than they look. Read our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review For just $79 / £69/ AU$99, the Jabra Elite 45h gives you Bluetooth 5 connectivity, 40mm full-range dynamic drivers and a smattering of physical push-button controls in a wireless on-ear frame. We like how the faux leather, memory foam and happily un-creaky plastic combined to deliver a fit we found extremely comfortable, although we weren't so keen on the way in which the ear pads reflect body heat right back: these phones get rather warm when you've been wearing them for a while. Tech-wise, they hit all the key features. There’s voice control available from Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. Jabra’s Sound+ control app even walks you through a brief hearing test to establish exactly how the EQs should be set to best suit your ears, giving you a surprisingly personal experience compared to others in this price range. By the standards of overtly affordable headphones, the Elite 45h are feature-packed. Read our full Jabra Elite 45h review Testing the Sony WH-CH510, we were amazed that wireless on-ear headphones could cost this little while delivering really decent sound, a USB-C port, and 35 hours of battery life. If you’re looking for headphones at this price point, you’re likely already willing to make a few sacrifices. Thankfully, most of the compromises Sony has made with the WH-CH510 haven’t been too crucial – the lack of analog input mirrors, the loss of the 3.5mm port on most modern smartphones – and while the construction is a little plasticky they're lightweight, portable and comfortable. While they won’t have the superb clarity, balance, and sense of space that their WH-1000XM4 siblings deliver, the sound these on-ear headphones produce is much better than you'd expect from their size and price. You’ll find most genres perform well here, although tracks that already have low mids and bumped treble might get uncomfortably exaggerated. Read our full Sony WH-CH510 review If money's no object, the Focal Stellia headphones could be the best headphones on the planet. The wide open soundstage on offer here and detailed, accurate sound treatment means they make any genre of music sound brilliant. If you listen to songs you think you know inside out, the precise separation of the frequencies here means that you will probably hear details you’ve never noticed before. If you like to keep things minimal in the headphones department, you probably won’t like the showy, opulent design of the Focal Stellias, and they definitely do feel a little chunky for wearing on the commute into work. But if you like a bit of luxury, the full-grain leather cups, woven cables, brushed copper accents, and matching carrying case are likely to appeal. That luxury feel is translated right down to the presentation of the user manuals in a neat little leather-style wallet. But then you'd expect to find this level of detail when you're parting with $3,000 / £2,799 (about AU$4,200). Ouch. Read our full Focal Stellia headphones review How to choose the best headphones for you Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. There's a lot to consider when you're buying a new pair of headphones. But the most important is the design. This doesn't just dictate how they look, but the features on offer, how they feel when you wear them and how you'll use them day-to-day. In-ear headphones, also called earbuds or earphones, are usually the cheapest and easiest way to pump audio into your ears. They rest in or just outside the ear canal, creating a tight seal to keep air out and sound in. These are the most discreet designs you'll find, making them excellent for portability and the prime choice for athletes. Over-ear headphones generally provide fantastic richness and depth of sound, which allows listeners to pick apart the instruments and sounds much easier. Additionally, over-ear, or circumaural headphones, go around the ear and offer a generous amount of padding. Instead of enveloping your ears, on-ear headphones create a light, breathable seal around your ear. The noise isolation is less effective than in-ear or over-ear options. But they're usually more portable than their over-ear brethren, appeal to travellers and make good fitness headphones. Some headphones don't go anywhere near your ears at all. Bone-conducting headphones send vibrations through your cheekbones and jaw up towards your inner ear, leaving your ears free. These headphones make great running headphones and swimming headphones. Wireless headphones fit into three different categories. Wireless in-ear earphones connected via a neckband are ideal for runners who want the freedom of a wireless connection with the security of a wire keeping their earbuds firmly around their neck. With wireless on-ear headphones and over-ear headphones, you simply lose the wire connecting them to your device – otherwise, they look pretty much the same as your regular pair of wired cans, and give you the noise-isolating prowess of over-ears without the need for cumbersome wires to connect to your device. True wireless earbuds have no cord whatsoever. For some, this means true freedom; for others, untethered true wireless means constant danger of losing their expensive audio kit down the drain – or terrible connections. The latter, at least, has changed now – thanks to advances in Bluetooth technology like aptX HD, the best true wireless earbuds have never sounded better. Are wired headphones better than wireless? Generally speaking, wired headphones do deliver better sound quality than wireless headphones. But there have been so many advances in audio tech in recent years, that with many of the best wireless headphones you're unlikely to notice a difference. That's why we often recommend audiophiles continue to opt for wired headphones. But for everyone else, it's mostly be down to personal preference. If wireless headphones suit you and are more convenient, they're a better choice for you. Get a good quality pair and you won't be missing out when it comes to sound quality. What are the best headphones I can buy right now? That depends on your preferences, style and budget. One of the most important considerations is design. Do you want a pair of in-ear headphones for running that are discrete and will stay snug all-day? Do you want a pair of true wireless headphones to give you ultimate flexibility? Or how about a big pair of over-ear headphones, the ultimate in noise cancellation and comfort? We've included a number of different headphone types below, like in-ear, on-ear, over-ear, wireless and true wireless. However, our top pick has to be the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. They're fantastic all-rounders, offering a long battery life, noise cancellation, and excellent audio quality for the price. What is the number 1 headphone brand? There's no one perfect headphone brand out there. It all depends on your budget, audio needs, the features you want, and even the comfort or design involved with the headphones. That's why we've included numerous headphones covering different price ranges and feature sets. While major brands like Sony and Bose may stand out most, that doesn't mean you shouldn't rule out the others, with something for everyone out there. How we test the best headphones When it comes to the best headphones, we focus on sound quality above everything else. We look at both wired and wireless cans and earbuds that would appeal to audiophiles, as well as those working in professional roles. However, we also appreciate that budget is important too, so we compare like for like, picking out budget headphones that perform admirably for the price. We also look at other features such as ANC, battery life, fit, and of course the usability and extra perks offered by any companion apps. Of course, design and whether they look (and feel) good all adds to the model's desirability – and this is noted as we listen to music across a wide range of genres over several days. We have tested all of the headphones in this guide extensively, spending plenty of time analyzing the sound, fit, design, specs, and value for money so that you will be able to choose a product you'll be over the moon with.

While less expensive pairs of headphones tend to miss out on some of these premium features, you can still find some well-rounded and versatile options that provide great value.

If you prefer a different sound, it can also be customized with a graphic EQ and presets in their companion app. Unfortunately, even with the EQ, you may find their sound somewhat muddy and cluttered. If that's a deal-breaker for you, you may want to consider the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless instead, which have a more neutral default sound profile with less overall bass.

They're an earlier version of the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless and aren't as well-built. However, they offer a better overall ANC performance than their successor and do a better job blocking out bass-range sounds like engine noise during your commute.

They have an excellent noise isolation performance, and their integrated mic has a much better performance. There's a drop in mic and audio quality when you're connected to a PC, but that's a limitation of Bluetooth.

However, the audio experts at CNET are here to help you narrow down the list as they've either fully reviewed or spent bounteous amounts of hands-on time with every pair of headphones you see on this page. With so many headphone and earbuds options available, we've had to create a number of best lists here at CNET to cover all the various model types and use-case scenarios. For this list, I've taken the best of the best headphones from several categories, including wired and wireless (that includes true-wireless earbuds) and distilled that information into a top overall headphones list. We either fully reviewed or had hands-on time with every model on the list. While many of the headphones on the list are premium models that cost a lot of money, we also like to highlight headphones that are a good value. These more affordable models can still deliver excellent quality at a good price. Regardless of budget or use case, this list will help you find the best headphones for you.

Such is the case for Sony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design, but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher $400 price tag ($50 more than the WH-1000XM4), most of those changes are good, and Sony's made some dramatic improvements with voice-calling performance as well as even better noise canceling and more refined sound. Read our Sony WH-1000XM5 review. Best compact noise-canceling wireless earbuds Yes (IPX4 -- splash-proof) The new AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are powered by Apple's new H2 chip, which delivers more processing power while being more energy efficient, according to Apple. The new chip, combined with new low-distortion drivers, allows for improved sound that offers better clarity and depth. The noise canceling is also improved -- Apple says the new AirPods have \\\"double\\\" the noise canceling of the original AirPods Pro. Additionally, the new AirPods add an extra hour of battery life, up from five to six hours with noise canceling on. Plus, a speaker in the case that emits a sound that helps locate your buds via Find My should they decide to hide from you. Note that while Apple has discontinued the original AirPods Pro, they'll remain on sale at discounted prices until supplies are exhausted. However, most people should get this newer model if they can afford it. They're IPX4 splash-proof. Read our Apple AirPods Pro 2 review. Best budget noise-canceling earbuds In the past, we've recommended Earfun's AirPro SV and Air Pro 2 as excellent budget noise-canceling earbuds choices (they're still good values). But the new-for-2022 Earfun Air S may be the best of the trio, with multipoint Bluetooth pairing, the latest Qualcomm QCC3046 SoC (system on a chip) with the AptX audio codec for Android and other devices that support it. It has the same 10mm wool drivers as the AirPro SV and features surprisingly impressive sound for its modest price point. They also work well as a headset for making calls with decent background noise reduction. The buds have an IPX5 water-resistance rating, which means they're splashproof and can withstand a sustained spray of water. Note that the earbuds cost as low as $49 when you activate the instant coupon and apply the CNET-exclusive discount code EFAIRS07 at checkout at Amazon. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 Best noise-canceling with top-notch sound Yes (IPX4 -- Splash-Proof Bose's second-generation QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are not only about 30% smaller than their predecessors, but their case is about 40% smaller and truly pocketable. They feature best-in-class noise canceling and improved sound, thanks to Bose's new CustomTune sound calibration system that customizes the sound for your ears. Voice-calling performance is also significantly better than that of the original QuietComfort Earbuds. The other big change is to the ear tips. Bose has ditched its one-piece StayEar wing tips for a two-piece Fit Kit system that features separate ear tips and \\\"stability bands\\\" in three size options, giving you more flexibility to get a secure fit and tight seal. The buds initially ship in the triple black color, with the sandstone option to follow later in the year. They're also IPX4 splash-proof. Read our Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 review. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 Best Sennheiser true-wireless Featuring excellent sound, improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well a smaller, more refined design that includes stabilizing fins (so the earbuds stay in your ears more securely), the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 are among the best new true-wireless earbuds for 2022. They're also among the best true-wireless earbuds overall, giving the Sony WF-1000XM4 a run for the money. Read our Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 review. Best wireless earbuds for sports Yes (IPX4 -- splash-proof) Hot on the heels of the third-generation AirPods, Apple has another new set of earbuds, this time from its subsidiary audio company, Beats. Technically, the new Beats Fit Pro ($200) aren't AirPods, but they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro. Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio, Adaptive EQ and IPX4 water-resistance (splash-proof). I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. And for some people, they might just be better than the AirPods Pro. Read our Beats Fit Pro review. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Best Samsung wireless earbuds The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer improved noise canceling along with very good sound and voice-calling performance, plus support for high-resolution wireless audio streaming if you're a Galaxy device owner with the right setup. That said, their biggest upgrade may be their new design and smaller size, which make them a better fit for more ears. They're also fully waterproof. Aside from their somewhat high price tag, their only drawback is that some of their key features only work with Samsung Galaxy devices. Read our Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review. Best Sony wireless earbuds Over-ear wireless headphones Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 buds were arguably the top overall earbuds for 2021 and part of 2022. They feature excellent sound and great noise-canceling with decent voice-calling capabilities and good battery life. They're still great earbuds but they've been surpassed in some ways by both Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds 2. That doesn't mean you shouldn't consider them, but look for them at a discount. Read our Sony WH-1000XM4 review. Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Flagship Sennheiser noise-canceling headphones Sennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern, and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors. The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, as well as the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \\\"assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\\\" Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offer \\\"best-in-class\\\" sound, which is debatable, of course. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to. Read our Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless first look. Best compact wireless earbuds from Sony Yes (IPX4 -- splash-proof) Unlike the \\\"open\\\" LinkBuds, the LinkBuds S are traditional noise-isolating earbuds with tips you jam in your ears. They're more compact and lighter than Sony's flagship WF-1000M4 and also feature Sony's V1 processor. While their sound and noise canceling don't quite measure up to the WF-1000XM4's, they're close and cost less. They're the Sony buds for people who can deal with larger buds like WF-1000XM4 but want 80 to 85% of those buds' features and performance for $80 less. Read our Sony LinkBuds S review. Great noise canceling Over-ear wireless headphones The QuietComfort 45 has virtually the same design as its predecessor, the QuietComfort QC35 II, which many people considered one of the most comfortable over-ear headphones -- if not the most comfortable. It has the same drivers, according to Bose, and the buttons are in the same place. However, there are small but notable changes. First off, these thankfully have USB-C instead of micro-USB. Secondly, the microphone configuration is different. Not only have the mics been shifted on the headphones, but there's now an extra external microphone for voice pick-up, which means the QC45 has a total of six microphones, four of which are beamforming and used for voice. By contrast, the QC35 II has a total of four, two of which are used for voice. (The Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 also have six microphones total.) These headphones are excellent for making calls. They're similar to the Bose Headphones 700 in that regard. They also include top-notch noise canceling and multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can connect them with a PC and your phone simultaneously. Read our full review of the QuietComfort 45. Master & Dynamic MW75 Great-sounding premium noise-canceling headphones The MW75 are Master & Dynamic's best full-size headphones yet. Needless to say, they're pricey at $599; most people will be quite satisfied with the $400 Sony WH-1000XM5, which are lighter and more comfortable, and which deliver best-in-class voice calling and noise canceling. But the MW75's build quality is hard to beat and they offer top-notch sound for a wireless model (I thought they sounded better than Apple's AirPods Max headphones), plus strong voice-calling and noise-canceling performance. With their support for aptX Adaptive, they have additional appeal for Android users, who can get a touch better sound quality with the right setup. But I was also quite happy streaming music with my iPhone 13 Pro using the AAC codec. Read our Master & Dynamic MW75 first take. Best AirPods Pro alternative for less Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging. The Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 are equipped with the same 11mm drivers, six microphones, oval tubes and oval silicon tips. Aside from the design, the biggest difference between the two buds is battery life; the stemless Live Free 2 is rated for up to seven hours, while the Live Pro 2 is rated for 10 hours. The Live Pro 2 is available in four color options. Read our JBL Live Pro 2 first take. Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 Next-gen Bowers & Wilkins noise-canceling headphones Available in three color options (gray, blue and black), Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 headphones offer some significant improvements over the first-generation version. Not only are these headphones more comfortable -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- but they sound better and have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5. But the PX7 S2 certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers very good sound with better voice-calling performance thanks to an upgraded microphone setup. Bowers & Wilkins has also released a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs more. Read our Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2 first take. Google Pixel Buds Pro Excellent wireless earbuds for Android users Yes (IPX4 -- splash-proof) The Pixel Buds Pro are Google's first earbuds to feature active noise canceling. While it's nice that they finally have a feature that a lot of true-wireless earbuds have had for a while, what ultimately sets the Pixel Buds Pro apart and makes them worth considering -- particularly for Android users -- is their distinct design and winning fit. That helps enhance their performance on both the sound quality and noise-canceling fronts. While not quite elite for voice-calling, they did perform well as a headset for making calls. A couple of features were missing at launch -- spatial audio and a five-band equalizer -- but the equalizer has now been added with a firmware update. We're now just waiting for spatial audio. The Pixel Buds Pro are also IPX4 splash-proof. Read our Google Pixel Buds review. Best-sounding wireless noise-canceling headphones French audio company Focal is known for its high-end speakers and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. Over three years in development, the Bathys cost $799 and feature not only wireless connectivity but a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) for USB wired listening with any computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C. They are easily one of the best-sounding wireless headphones. Read our Focal Bathys first take. Best Jabra true-wireless Coming in at 16% smaller than the Elite 75t, the Elite 7 Pro are Jabra's top-of-the-line earbuds in its new range and include the company's new MultiSensor Voice technology with a bone-conduction sensor, four microphones and intelligent algorithms to deliver new \\\"ground-breaking call quality,\\\" Jabra says. The voice calling performance doesn't quite live up to the hype, but Jabra has updated the buds' firmware, adding multipoint Bluetooth pairing and slightly improving sound quality, noise canceling and headset performance. It took a while but they're now excellent all-around buds. These have adjustable active noise cancellation, Jabra's HearThrough transparency mode and Bluetooth 5.2. They offer up to nine hours' play time at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on, and nearly three additional charges in the charging case -- total battery life is rated at 35 hours. The charging case has wireless charging capabilities. The earbuds' IP57 rating means they are dust-resistant and fully waterproof (they can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water). For those who like to use only a single bud, you can also use either one independently in a mono mode. Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pro X Best wired studio headphones Over-ear wired headphones We were fans of Beyerdynamic's earlier DT 770 Pro headphones. The new DT 700 X is easier to drive than the 770 Pro, thanks to the company's new STELLAR.45 sound transducer with an impedance of 48 ohms, so it plays better with smartphones, tablets and laptops without requiring a headphone amp. The headphone is targeted at content creators who want accurate audio reproduction, but it's a bit more dynamic sounding and less bass shy than many studio headphones, which tend to restrain the bass and hew toward a very neutral sound profile. The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. Unlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a little cleaner look than its predecessor. The solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. Beyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in. This closed-back version is more versatile. Yes (IPX4 -- splash-proof) Take one look at the new design of the third-gen AirPods, and the first thing you'll probably think is: \\\"Those look like the AirPods Pro without ear tips.\\\" You wouldn't be wrong. While they're more fraternal than identical twins, the AirPods 3 are shaped like the AirPods Pro, with the same shorter stems and same pinch controls as those of the Pro. Aside from the design change, which should fit most ears better than the AirPods 2nd Generation (though not very small ears), the biggest change is to the sound quality: It's much improved. Also, battery life is better, and the AirPods 3 are water-resistant. Read our Apple AirPods 3 review. Apple's premium noise-canceling headphones Over-ear wireless headphones Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions. Read our Apple AirPods Max review. Grado SR225x Prestige Series Best affordable open-back wired headphones Over-ear wired headphones (listed as on-ear) Grado has upgraded its entry-level line of Prestige Series wired headphones for 2021. Hand-built, the line includes the SR60x, SR80x, SR125x, SR225x and SR325x, and they're all very good at their various prices. Arguably, however, the $225 SR225x hits the sweet spot if you're looking for open-back audiophile-grade headphones that won't cost you an arm and a leg. This updated model features a more durable eight-conductor cable infused with \\\"super annealed\\\" copper for \\\"improved purity of the audio signal,\\\" a more comfortable headband design and updated fourth-generation 44mm drivers that further cut down on distortion and are also more energy-efficient, making them easier to drive. I not only used them with an external headphone amplifier attached to my computer but with an iPhone using a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter. They had plenty of volume when connected directly to the iPhone. Open-back headphones are supposed to produce more open sound and these do just that with powerful, controlled bass and natural, warm-sounding mids (where vocals live) along with excellent overall clarity. Stepping up to the SRS325x should give you a little bit more bass energy, but you're not looking at a big jump in sound quality. As with any open-back headphones, these do leak some sound, so people around you can hear what you're listening to. These headphones have semisoft foam earpads that, when you first put them on, you wouldn't think are that comfortable over longer listening sessions. But they end up being more comfortable than you'd expect and the new headband design does help in that department. For entry-level audiophile-grade headphones that cost less than $250, it's hard to do better than the SR225x. Best audiophile headphones from V-Moda V-Moda's M-200 are currently only one of three pairs of wired headphones on this list. Released in late 2019, these clean and detailed sounding over-ear headphones have excellent bass response, and the cushy ear cushion cups mean they're also comfortable to wear. Featuring 50mm drivers with neodymium magnets, CCAW voice coils and fine-tuning by Roland engineers -- yes, V-Moda is now owned by Roland -- the M‑200 is Hi‑Res Audio certified by the Japan Audio Society. Other V-Moda headphones tend to push the bass a little, but this set has the more neutral profile that you'd expect from studio monitor headphones. It comes with two cords, one of which has a built-in microphone for making calls. It would be nice if V-Moda offered Lightning or USB-C cables for phones without headphone jacks. Note that in 2021, V-Moda released the M-200 ANC ($500), a wireless version of these headphones that includes active noise canceling. They also sound great but their noise canceling, call quality and overall feature set don't match those of the AirPods Max.

The best of these wireless options combine stellar audio with powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) and other handy tools to create as complete a package as possible. Of course, some companies do this better than others. For Engadget’s best wireless headphones guide, we tested out a number of different models with a variety of features, including noise cancellation and sound quality. Plus, our favorites span a range of prices so you can decide how much you’re comfortable spending. Best overallSony WH-1000XM5$398 $398 at Amazon $398 at Amazon Runner upBowers & Wilkins Px7 S2$399 $399 at Amazon $399 at Amazon Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2 Best budgetAudio-Technica ATH-M20xBT$79 $79 at Amazon $79 at Amazon Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT Another solid optionBose QuietComfort 45$329 $329 at Amazon $329 at Amazon Another solid optionTechnics EAH-A800-K$298 $298 at Amazon $298 at Amazon Another solid optionMaster & Dynamic MW75$599 $599 at Amazon $599 at Amazon Master & Dynamic MW75 Another solid optionSennheiser Momentum 4$294 $294 at Amazon $294 at Amazon Sennheiser Momentum 4 Best overall: Sony WH-1000XM5 Until another company can pack in as many features as Sony, and do so with a stellar mix of sound and effective ANC, the crown is safe with the WH-1000XM5. Sony’s 1000X line has been our top pick for best wireless headphone for a long time now. Until another company can pack in as many features as Sony, and do so with a stellar mix of sound and effective ANC, the crown is safe. With the WH-1000XM5, Sony redesigned its flagship headphones, making them way more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The company also made noticeable improvements to the active noise cancellation, adding a separate V1 chip in addition to the QN1 that was inside the M4. There are now eight total ANC mics as well – the previous model only had four. This all combines to better block background noise and high frequencies, including human voices. The 1000XM5 still has all of the features that typically make Sony’s top-of-the-line headphones showstoppers. That includes 30-hour battery life and crisp, clear sound with balanced tuning and punchy bass. A combo of touch controls and physical buttons give you on-board access to music, calls and noise modes without reaching for your phone. Speak-to-Chat automatically pauses audio when you begin talking, and like previous Sony headphones, the M5 can change noise modes based on your activity or location. Plus, this model offers better call quality than most of the competition. The only real downside is that they’re $50 more than the WH-1000XM4 at full price ($400). Runner up: Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2 Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2 Bowers & Wilkins pair impressive audio quality with solid ANC performance in the Px7 S2, along with a more refined design that's comfortable and doesn’t look overly plasticky. I’ll admit I didn’t expect Bowers & Wilkins to make the year's best headphones list, or even be in contention for a spot. However, the company’s revised Px7 headphones impressed me during my review. The Px7 S2 are pricey at $399, but Bowers & Wilkins pair impressive audio quality with solid ANC performance. In fact, the Px7 S2 are my favorite headphones right now in terms of sound. There’s also a more refined design that doesn’t look overly plasticky and the headphones fit comfortably even after hours of use. Call quality, ambient sound and automatic pausing aren’t the best here, but they get the job done. At the end of the day, the design, sound quality and noise cancellation make the Px7 S2 a strong pick in the current true wireless headphone field. Best budget: Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT For just $79, you can expect a comfy fit and up to 60 hours of battery life, along with Bluetooth multipoint connectivity and onboard physical-button controls. Audio-Technica has introduced affordable wireless headphones in the past, and while they didn’t offer active noise cancellation, they’re still worth considering. The company’s latest is the M20xBT, a Bluetooth version of the A-T’s popular M20x wired cans. For just $79, you can expect a comfy fit and up to 60 hours of battery life. Bluetooth multipoint connectivity allows you to connect to multiple devices at once and physical buttons provide reliable on-board control. The design isn’t as refined as the company’s pricer models like the M50xBT2, but you get the bulk of what makes Audio-Technica’s cheaper options so good. Another solid option: Bose QuietComfort 45 The QC45 combines Bose’s excellent active noise cancellation with clear and balanced audio, plus an excellent 24-hour battery life. The Bose 700 was one of our top wireless Bluetooth headphones last time around, but the company recently revived a workhorse with the QuietComfort 45. The design is mostly unchanged from the previous QC models, which could be a deal breaker for some. Once you get past that though, the QC45 combines Bose’s excellent active noise cancellation with clear and balanced audio. You can expect up to 24 hours of battery life on a charge and a comfortable fit that doesn’t get tiresome during long listening sessions. We’ve already seen them on sale for $50 less than full price, which makes the QuietComfort 45 even more compelling. Another solid option: Technics EAH-A800 Along with an impressive 50-hour battery life with ANC, these Technics headphones have good sound quality and a comfortable fit. Back at CES 2022, Panasonic announced the EAH-A800: a new set of active noise canceling headphones under the iconic Technics brand. While most of the features are what you see on any number of wireless headphones, one figure stood out. The company says you can expect up to 50 hours of battery life on the A800, and that’s with active noise cancellation enabled. These are currently in my stable of review units for detailed analysis, but I have already tested them on a long flight. The ANC is impressive and they’re comfortable enough to avoid becoming a burden after several hours. Sound quality is also quite good (there’s LDAC support, too) and there are enough features here to justify the premium price tag. Another solid option: Master & Dynamic MW75 Master & Dynamic MW75 They don't come cheap, but the MW75 has an attractive design that takes cues from Master & Dynamic's MG20 gaming headset and mixes them with a combo of aluminum, leather and tempered glass. While Master & Dynamic is known for its design prowess, the company’s over-ear headphones were due for a refresh. With the MW75 that debuted in June, the company opted for a look that takes cues from its MG20 gaming headset and mixes them with a combo of aluminum, leather and tempered glass. The company’s trademark sound quality returns with multiple ANC modes and ambient sound options for a range of situations. At $599, the high-end looks don’t come cheap, but if you’re looking for something beyond the pure plastic fashion of most headphones, M&D has you covered. Another solid option: Sennheiser Momentum 4 Sennheiser Momentum 4 Sennheiser's Momentum 4 has an impressive 60-hour battery life and improved ANC performance, but albeit with a somewhat bland design. I’ll be honest, I had a hard time choosing between the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 for the runner-up spot this time around. However, Bowers & Wilkins gets the edge in terms of design even though the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are very evenly matched on sound quality. They’re the two best-sounding sets of Bluetooth headphones I’ve tested this year – and it’s not even close. Sennheiser does have an impressive 60-hour battery life in its favor and improved ANC performance. Those two items alone might be enough for you to overlook the very generic design. How can you tell the quality of headphones? I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if headphones feel cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality. How do I choose the best quality headphones? “Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Do you want the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing? Which brand has the best headphones? Sony consistently tops our list with its 1000X line. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, like Bose, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line. Do expensive headphones sound better? Exorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality. Bowers & Wilkins’ headphones are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, Audio-Technica’s M50xBT2 is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.

i've recently decided that i need to get better at focusing and so obviously a pair of noise cancelling headphones is the way to guarantee this and so in this video we're going to be testing these top six noise cancelling headphones to figure out which of these is the best on the market and which of these i am going to buy for myself now the cool thing is we actually have a whole range of these in different price points we have the ridiculously cheap anchor sound cores we have the microsoft surface headphone 2. we have the sony wh xm 1000 m4 or something like that we have the bose qc700s we have the apple airport max and we have the stupidly expensive b and o b o plate h95 and so for each of these what we did is that i tested them extensively myself and we got a few team members to test them all as well and we're going to rate them all in terms of aesthetics in terms of fit and comfort in terms of noise cancellation and in terms of sound quality for music now as you know i'm a fan of upfront conclusions so i'm just going to come out and say that the ones i'll be getting are the sony wh mx4s whatever they're called if you're on a budget the anker sound cores are actually surprisingly reasonable and if you don't care about long-term comfort and are happy to spend a bit more money the apple airpods maxes are the choice for you so if that's all you wanted from the video then thank you very much for watching and do please have a great rest of day but now we're going to go over these one at a time and i'm going to share the pros and the cons of each of these six pairs of headphones and i'll show the results of my personal and our team testing about the various factors so that whichever one of these you're buying you can make hopefully a slightly more informed decision about the noise canceling headphones that are obviously going to change your life so we're going to start with the cheapest ones and these are the anker soundcore q30s which retail for about 100 and if you're on a budget these are actually a really good option and probably the best value for money that you can get in terms of the noise cancellation headphone wireless headphone market their design is a little bit plasticky and flimsy and they come with this sound core case thing which again is nothing to write home about it's got these little cheapy cheap looking pieces of foam in it as well but to be honest for the price it's not bad at all in terms of fit and comfort it's actually pretty reasonable in terms of looks these did get the lowest rating from our team members and from me with most of us rating it either a one or two for an average rating of 1.5 stars in terms of looks but in terms of fit and comfort they're actually pretty reasonable and most of us rated them a four or three so this got a rating of 3.5 in terms of fit and comfort now when it comes to noise cancellation i'm gonna be honest like i tested these fairly extensively and i didn't really notice much of a difference between the noise cancelling capabilities of the different headphones in fairness we are in this fairly quiet environment if i was in an airplane or on a train or in the london underground maybe the noise cancelling test would have been better but as far as i could really tell they were all fairly similar in terms of noise cancelling ability but in terms of sound quality there were some noticeable differences between the six headphones in the lineup the sound is pretty good but i'm not like wowed by it i'm still getting that kind of like cheap feel and these ones clocked in fairly reasonably with an average rating of 3.75 stars across our team the battery life on these is absolutely incredible it's 40 hours apparently with noise cancelling and 60 hours if you turn off the noise cancelling and they've got a few buttons on the bottom where you can increase the volume or decrease the volume or hit play and pause again these are nothing to write home about but if for example you're a student and you're on a budget and you do want a pair of noise cancelling headphones to make it easier to focus when you're working or if you're in a coffee shop or whatever then these are by far the best value for money and they also fall down nicely and can go kind of go into this case and you can shove this little piece of plastic in there somewhere if you really want to but yeah fairly reasonable option if you are on a budget moving up a little bit in terms of price point we now have the microsoft surface headphones too which retail for around about 270 dollars now in terms of aesthetics i actually quite like these especially because they're this sort of silvery whitey kind of color and i'm a fan of things that look white broadly and they have these interesting features in that on both knobs you can like turn the knobs so one of the knobs is full volume and the other knob is for the noise cancellation ability of the headphones allegedly they have multi-device support and so they can connect to two devices at once and allegedly it can switch between your iphone and your macbook if it recognizes you're getting a phone call in practice this feature does not work like it has never once actually worked as intended for me and in terms of battery life it's fairly low it's got around about 18 hours of battery life which means you do have to charge it somewhat regularly if you're going to be using it extensively for long work sessions in terms of aesthetics i gave this a five star rating but some of the team gave it a three and four star so the average rating of this was four stars and in terms of fit and comfort it's actually very reasonable i've got fives and fours across the board with an average rating of 4.3 stars but sadly in terms of sound quality these are just not as good as some of the alternatives so i gave this personally a three out of five in terms of sound quality which was kind of what the team thought as well so this had an average rating of 3.3 stars in terms of music quality so i actually used to use these for about six months in 2021 and i really liked them mostly because of the aesthetic they were quite nice to be honest i hadn't a b tested them with a bunch of different headphones to be honest all these review videos are somewhat artificial because once you have one of these headphones it doesn't really matter which one you have you kind of then just get used to it and that becomes the new normal it's only when you really compare them side by side with like kind of six other headphones that you start to quibble about things like noise quality but broadly i was a big fan of them um when i had them and i like the fact that they came with this nice little case which meant i could just chuck it in my bag and the case had a nice little slot for the cables as well then sadly my tesla got broken into and these got stolen so this is just a pair that we ordered for review purposes but after testing them side by side with all the others i've decided that i'm no longer going to be using the microsoft surface headphones too because the sonys are just a little bit better than them across all fronts except the aesthetics anyway that brings us on to the sony what are they called the sony wh-1000xm4s this is the only real problem with these is that it's impossible to remember what the name is sony really needs to come up with a better way of naming these headphones but they are the ones that i'm going to be now switching to because i think they're the perfect mix of comfort and sound quality and noise cancellation and battery life even if the aesthetic is just slightly less nice than the microsoft surface headphones too now in terms of fit and comfort these actually were the best headphones that we tested they were the most comfortable buy a reasonable margin decent very comfortable most comfortable yet and i think the main reason for that is that these are just so light they are i think probably the lightest out of the six headphones that we've tested although i haven't measured it just on my head they feel really light and when it comes to wearing these for extended periods of time really the comfort correlates strongly with how heavy the headphones are or rather how light the headphones are because the main problem with the airpods max for example like they're amazing in sound quality they're amazing in battery life they're amazing across all fronts it's just that they're really heavy and after like an hour of using them my head starts to hurt from having such heavy headphones on it and so the fact that the sony's are so comfortable to wear for very extended periods of time i think it's mostly down to just how light they are in terms of looks yeah they're not bad the team thought they were five stars and four stars in terms of looks i'd personally rate them a three star because i do prefer the look of the microsoft surface headphones but i mean they're very reasonable they look like just a normal pair of noise cancelling headphones nothing to write home about and in terms of design they fold up nicely like this so it's very easy to pack into a bag and they also come with this little carry case that if you want you can put them in i'm probably not going to do that because that's too much faff i'm just probably going to stick them in my bag exactly like that they charge like all these do by usbc that's pretty standard and unsurprisingly they've got a power button and a button that lets you control the level of noise cancellation in terms of battery life these are actually really good they're advertised as having 30 hours of battery life with the noise cancellation and 38 hours without noise cancellation if you're not into noise cancellation for whatever reason and in terms of sound quality for listening to music i personally thought these were really good i gave them a four star rating sadly this was not mirrored by our team who thought they were more like two stars and three stars in terms of noise quality and so the overall rating for this in terms of sound quality is 3.5 stars but personally i think that's a little bit of an under estimate of what's the actual i say actual my my personal subjective interpretation of their their music quality was and to be honest this sort of subjectiveness you get a lot when it comes to testing headphones like i'm not an audiophile no one in our team is really an audiophile and so we don't objectively know what these headphones sound like all we can say is what our subjective experience like oh this sounds a bit better than that and after doing a bunch of hot swapping to be like are these really sounding better than the surface are these really sounding better than the boses i kind of decided at the end that like yeah whenever i put these on my head i felt ah these are so comfortable and i also felt that oh the sound quality on these is pretty good yeah not as good as the airpods max airplanes backs max wins across the board just blew everyone else out of the water in terms of sound quality but i don't think that trade-off is warranted given how heavy they are and therefore how uncomfortable they are for long periods of time at least for me and so the sony's are the ones that i'm going to be holding on to i haven't figured out whether i want them in white or silver or in blue i'm not too much of a fan of this matte black color but hey they're really good and these are now going to be a staple part of my everyday carry all right now we're spending a little bit more money and we come to the bose qc 700s which retail for 350 but these are a little bit more expensive than the sony's and actually i think the main selling point is the look it does look quite nice um our team was a bit uh split on whether we liked this particular style with these like yeah it's just a slightly different design to most noise cancelling headphones i personally quite like them but in terms of comfort they're not quite as good as the sony's and in terms of sound quality for me also they're not quite as good as the sony's our team rated these pretty poorly across the board so this got an average of 3.25 stars when it came to fit and comfort it got a three stars in terms of noise cancellation and it got a 3.1 stars in terms of sound quality and a 3.2 stars in terms of look so like broadly if we averaged the four four five four four team members that we had testing these broadly we weren't a fan these are actually the ones i've been using for the last six months since my tesla got broken into and i lost my microsoft surface headphones too i've actually been using these but i'm going to give them away to a friend and instead replace them with the sony's because the sony's are marginally better in terms of comfort and in terms of sound quality next we come to the apple airpod maxes which are really expensive and retail for around about 640 dollars at least if you convert the pounds we'll put the actual dollar price over here now these come with the case but we have two team members gordon angus in our studio who use these and they never carry the case with them similarly when i used to use the apple airpods max i never carry the case because the case is totally pointless and genuinely these are really good the sound quality is just way better than all of the other headphones that we tested and when you put these on you immediately think oh my god this sounds incredible compared to the other noise cancelling headphones and anyway it kind of screws up your mind a bit or your ear rather because it makes you think that the others sound bad in comparison to this but then after a while of getting used to the others you stop you you kind of forget what it was like to wear the apple airpods max this is probably the best sounding of them all the sound is amazing the design is a bit polarizing i quite like the blue color personally rather than the black and they've got this little mesh thing at the top which is kind of comfortable but the main thing the main drawback of these as i've said is that they're just too heavy they're very comfortable for short amounts of time but for more than about half an hour i started to find my kind of ears getting a bit tired my head getting a bit tired maybe i'm not hench enough to handle these but i just i just really wasn't a fan in terms of long-term comfort levels now if you have apple devices these are actually really good because there is a chip or something inside them that makes them pair with iphones and macs really easily so you can literally just wear them and they will automatically pair to your iphone or to your mac and really that means that there isn't actually a way of turning them off the way they go into standby mode is when you put them in the case but given that realistically no one really carries the case around because it's kind of useless it does have that slight quirk to them it's got a little button at the top which acts as a little sort of volume dial and also if you press the button down you can access siri but the issue is that these are the only phones that don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so if you listen to stuff on airplanes a lot and you want to plug your headphones into the aeroplane system thingy so that you can watch a movie on the aeroplane using your fancy noise canceling headphones you can do that with all the others but you can't do it with the apple airpods max this is not a huge problem like to be honest these were the clear winners in most of the categories in terms of comfort so yeah great pair of headphones super expensive but you do get fantastic sound quality for that but they are not for me because i just can't handle them in terms of the heaviness and the discomfort and finally we come to the big daddies the b o b o play h95s which are ridiculously expensive these come in at 940 or thereabouts and they have they have these like leather thingies around them i think you can actually take these off yeah you can take them off they have leather around them they have this leather thing at the top so it's like a more premium higher end feel to these noise canceling headphones but sadly they are just not very good in terms of the aesthetics our team was a bit split on them i quite like these metal bits and i would have even liked the nordic ice color because these come in a multitude of colors and that color looks really cool but again they run into into the same issue that the airpods max do in that they are quite heavy and so wearing them for extended periods of time can actually get a little bit uncomfortable sound quality as well again it's reasonable most of our team rated them somewhere between three and four stars i would just thought that the sound would be better for this price so the sound quality doesn't feel amazing i thought these were a three star personally i did personally prefer the sound quality of the sony's despite the fact that these are like triple the price but i guess what you're really paying for here is the sort of more premium leather feel of the noise cancelling headphones and to be honest i liked the nordic ice color at least on the website so much that if these were slightly lighter i probably would have gone for these just to have the flecks of like having a really nicely aesthetic pair of headphones sadly they're not comfortable enough to even warrant that so basically i'm not a fan of these despite them being quite expensive and quite high-end oh the other cool thing about them is that they do come in this fancy like metal case thing which feels feels very high-end feels very premium makes you think feel healed oh sick but it's also a case that's quite heavy by itself and so it's not a case that you're really going to be carrying in a backpack it's more for the kind of aesthetics of the unboxing experience and so that you can feel oh i'm a legend because i wear bang olufsen noise canceling headphones now in terms of practical uses of these noise canceling headphones there's three main domains that have made up the bulk of my use of these over the last few years firstly it's listening to my study with me playlist on spotify while i'm trying to work or focus or do any kind of deep work at all second it's consuming things like music and podcast and audiobooks while i'm on things like trains and airplanes because the noise canceling is really helpful and thirdly i find these noise canceling headphones really helpful if i'm editing videos because then with the noise cancelling i can edit videos wherever i go and speaking of editing videos another tool that i find incredibly helpful is called storyblocks who are very kindly sponsoring this video i've been using storyblocks since i started this youtube channel five years ago in 2017. droidblocks is absolutely fantastic it is a subscription service that gives you royalty-free stock photos and stock videos and stock music that you can use in youtube videos just like this one in fact when we got team members to test out the headphones some of the tracks we were using were from storyblocks royalty free so that we can include them in this video without getting copyright stricken for them me and our editors personally find storyblocks super helpful when we're trying to find b-roll and especially in the early days of this youtube channel when i was trying to juggle making videos with the demands of being a medical student and later the demands of being a doctor it was super helpful to have this library of high quality stock footage available to use as b-roll so that i didn't necessarily have to go out and spend hours and hours shooting my own b-roll for all the videos that i was making and other than just videos and music storyblocks also has things like after effect templates and premiere pro templates for titles lower thirds transitions and even sound effects that you can incorporate into your videos whenever you want storyblocks has subscriptions for any budget and so if you want to check it out then do hit the link in the video description so thank you so much storyblocks for sponsoring this video and for helping out the channel over the last five years so overall when it comes to these headphones the budget pick is the anker sound cores which are very reasonable my personal pick is the sony wh mx1000 xm4s or whatever they're called and if you don't care about the comfort thing the airpods maxes are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality if you like this video you might be interested in what sort of podcasts i listen to with my fancy pair of noise cancelling headphones and that'll be in a video over there called 20 podcasts that made me millionaire so thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye \"}, {\"link\":

the headphones landscape the last few years there are plenty of people who still like the full size variety and that's why I put together this Roundup of the best wireless noise canceling over-ear headphones of 2022. that'll be clear these are headphones that were released in 2022 and I haven't included any models that came out in years past I've narrowed it down to my five favorites with an additional affordable pick thrown in because when you get into these top wireless headphones well they tend to be rather expensive and a lot of people just can't afford them but we're talking about the best of the best so here we go here are my picks from highest to lowest price [Music] at 799 we have the focal bathies focal is a French Audio company known for its high-end speakers and wired headphones some of which cost thousands of dollars it's finally done with a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go Wireless music listening make active noise canceling Bluetooth headphones but they also have a built-in DAC that stands for digital to analog converter for USB wirelessening with any computer smartphone or tablet with USBC and that makes it easy to go from Wireless to wirelessening for slightly better sound the bathys build quality and design are excellent they're comfortable to wear and they're easily one of the best sounding wireless headphones they offer excellent Clarity detail accuracy and Powerful well-defined bass that's got the right amount of warp to it they have a spacious Sound Stage for closed back headphones anyway and they allow you to hear each instrument distinctly in complicated tracks where several instruments are playing at the same time the bathies use aluminum magnesium speaker drivers while focals higher end wired headphones have beryllium drivers that offer even more clarity and accuracy with the right setup their noise canceling isn't as strong or as good as what you get with the Sony wh-1000 Xbox 5 or the Bose quiet Comfort 45 headphones for example but focal has done its best to implement noise canceling without sacrificing sound quality which is always a challenge they're also good for making calls so a really great headphone overall but out of most people's price range though it is cheaper than the mark Levinson number 5909 headphones that go for around a thousand bucks okay moving on to the Bowers and Wilkins px8 at 699 when they originally announced the Swanky px8 were supposed to cost 549 for essentially the same price as Apple's airpods max headphones however when they finally hit stores the px8s price jumped to 6.99 or a full 300 more than the company stepped down px7 Series 2 headphones which are also excellent the biggest difference between the px8 and the px7 S2 are the px8s all new 40 millimeter carbon cone drive units that are inspired by the carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 series loudspeaker line Bowers and Wilkins says these units help deliver Superior resolution detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the px7s II based on my test that's true I like the px7s2 the px8 headphones do sound more special with the touch more openness and overall Clarity the right near the top for sound in a Bluetooth headphone and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions for the best sound you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USBC to USBC cable as for the noise canceling function it's good but not quite on par with what you get with the Sony wh-1000x Mark V and while the voice calling capabilities are solid these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls however the transparency mode is Top Notch while I can't say they're worth 300 more than the px7 S2 they're a great set of cans if you can afford them I do prefer the sound and overall performance with a more expensive focal bathies that the bathies don't have such strong noise canceling but the px8 are a close second at 5.99 we have the master of dynamic mw75 headphones the company's best headphones to date a last metal construction adds weight but that's a trade-off some people don't mind the mw75 sound excellent with clean accurate sound natural sounding mids and nice treble detail the base is tight and Punchy with just enough warmth the mw75 seem well suited for all types of music genres and I had no trouble wearing the headphones for longer listening sessions though I would have liked the ear pads to be slightly larger I thought they measured up well against the Apple airpods Max for sound quality the mw75 came across as the more accurate natural sounding headphones the airpods max had a little more energy and played a little louder but the mw75 sounded a bit smoother and a tad more articulate it's also worth noting that while the mw75 don't have quite the noise canceling capabilities of the Sony wh-1000x Mark V they do offer very good noise canceling and are also very good for making calls another great headphone overall speaking of the Sony that's the next headphone on this list it's 400 though it's been discounted lately to around 350 this is the headphone that's going to hit the sweet spot for a lot of people it's relatively lightweight and comfortable sounds really good and offers top-notch noise canceling and noise reduction during voice calls Some people prefer the dual hinge design at the earlier 1000x mark IV which offers a little more bass energy but I personally prefer the slightly more refined sound of the Mark V and particularly appreciated the improvements to the call Quality well the Sony doesn't sound quite as good as the models I've already talked about it does have some nice extra features like Sony speak to chat mode and it does cost less and has Best in Class noise canceling at number five I have sennheiser's momentum for wireless a 350 headphone that's been selling for closer to 300 while some people may be a little disappointed that their design has become a bit too straightforward and less distinctive with less premium materials than the previous momentum three they essentially check all the boxes for what you want in a premium noise canceling headphone from the standpoint of comfort features and performance initially I wasn't wowed by them but after I broke them in for a few days their sound grew on me and Sennheiser has improved not only their noise canceling performance but also their voice calling performance and unlike the previous momentum 3 they do fold flat and have incredible battery life at up to 60 hours depending on what I was listening to there were times when I thought they did sound slightly better than the Sony's they're just a tad more natural and accurate sounding and they do cost less than the Sony so that's another reason to consider them last but not least I have my value pick the sound core by anchor space Q45 which is currently selling for around 130 if you can afford Sony's 1000x Mark V or the similarly named Bose qc45 yes there's a bit of copying going on here the space Q45 is a good alternative it's comfortable to wear with nicely padded ear cups and a dual hinge folding design sound quality is very good and the headphones offer better noise canceling than the step down Q35 as well as multi-point Bluetooth pairing and they do support the ldac audio codec for streaming high resolution music tracks over Bluetooth if you have a device that supports ldac many Android phones do although Samsung's Galaxy phones don't battery life is also very good at up to 50 hours with noise canceling on to be clear this headphone isn't up to level of the other headphones in this Roundup but it's Anchor's best sounding noise canceling headphone to date and a good value relatively speaking so that's it those are my top over ear wireless headphones of 2022 if you want more info about any of these products we've got links to

best headphones in 2023 through extensive research and testing I've put together a list of options that'll meet the needs of different types of buyers so whether it's price performance or its particular use we've got you covered for more information on the products I've included links in the description box down below which are updated for the best prices like the video comment and don't forget to subscribe now let's get started we'll start our list of reviews with the Bose QuietComfort 45 which in our opinion are the best noise canceling headphones available on the market in 2023 they resemble their predecessor and look and feel and have active noise cancellation ANC technology that is particularly effective in blocking external sounds overall they perform very well with a neutral sound profile 21 plus hours of continuous playback and an extremely comfortable fit they're easy to use and Incredibly comfortable of course the Bose QuietComfort 45 have a few new tricks up their sleeves one of them is the ambient to wear mode which allows us to hear sounds around us at the push of a button along with improved noise cancellation technology that's more sensitive than before luckily they include fast charging which allows you to charge them up in the morning before heading out for work the design remains consistent the Leather Ear cushions and padded foam Bridge give the headphones a nice elegant feel while also being lightweight weighing only 238 grams making them comfortable to wear for long periods of time when not worn around the neck they easily store in the included carrying case as they rotate and fold to fit into it perfectly Bose has equipped a quiet Comfort 45 with simple controls placed on either ear cup pause play buttons on one side and volume up and down buttons on the other side along with the button for their aware mode that lets Ambient sound filter through without having to take off your headphones connecting them is an effortless task as both the 2.5 to 3.5 millimeter trrs connection found in the box or Bluetooth 5.1 Hardware hidden behind Works equally well allowing you to connect them with your smartphone or other sources seamlessly the sound character is dominated by medium and high frequencies making it suitable for podcasts or music that have strong vocal components ultimately reproducing brighter tones that are easy on your ears thumbs up that's for sure the next product in our review list is the Sennheiser momentum 4 wireless also known as the best sounding headphones in 2023 these headphones have all the latest features including battery life and sound better than Sony's XM series Sennheiser has gone from creating a design just for headphone enthusiasts to one that'll appeal to a mass audience from those who work from home to airplane commuters the momentum 4 wireless is comfortable to wear all day long no tight crowns sweaty ears or other fatigue inducing elements operating them is easy too press one button for three seconds to power it up or down while other controls such as play pause skip forward backward and volume control are placed on the right ear cup surface there's even an amp with decent functionality that lets you set ANC to automatically or manually alter its Effectiveness the connectivity of these headphones is excellent too with Bluetooth 5 and an impressively long range you won't experience any issues there as for battery life you're looking at 60 hours with ANC on and more when it's off a remarkable autonomy that surpasses even the best headphones out there noise cancellation performance of the momentum Wireless 4 works great in practice and should make most users pretty happy the sound quality is something else entirely refined based detail and presence no other brand can match deep melodic bass sure to please audio files plus treble that boasts articulation detail and texture like none other this is a quality product and all we can do is recommend it if you're looking for headphones that'll provide you with even greater value for money we especially recommend the Jabra Elite 45h these are compact Bluetooth headphones with ear cushions available at a very affordable price there is no active noise cancellation at this price but it promises a stratospheric 50 hours of battery life all under the watchful eye if your jabber sound Plus app the earpads are equal parts serious and classic crafted in rather high quality synthetic leather elegantly perforated by the brand jabber takes care to provide a small lightly padded carrying case and Elemental courtesy to at least protect against dust impacts charging is via a USBC connection and leg beats fairly recent solo Pro the connector has been released so there's no standby mode and no ability to use the headphones on a pure USBC connection the headset does not constrict the ears too much allowing them to breathe relatively well while properly adapting to different body types the swivel side of the shells allow you to leave some latitude for example for slightly protruding ears this low setting allows almost no pressure to be felt during long sessions and even those who wear glasses can use them comfortably on the remotes buttons on the right there is the on off pairing switch play pause button and volume buttons also used to change tracks like most other jobber products including true Wireless they are multi-point can connect to two transmitters simultaneously which is rare enough in this price range to pull off on top of that comes a five band graphic equalizer accompanied by a number of preset equalizers as well as the ability to edit your own settings in use it meets expectations stable connection with a very good range and very few errors or sound jumps due to its lack of A and C combined with more average measured power and basic codecs SBC only thumbs up that's for sure if you don't hesitate to spend a few extra bucks we're highlighting the powers and Wilkins px7s2 the best premium headphones in 2023 with tons of new features and Hardware updates it has great potential to compete with other Premium Bluetooth headphones on the surface the design looks solid and appealing with a pleasant mix of smooth and stitched textures providing uniformity the construction is durable with evenly placed buttons and smooth turns underneath all of it are the Bowers and Wilkins custom 40 millimeter drivers constructed with low Distortion biocellulose diaphragms and a wireless platform capable of 24-bit low latency transmission for exceptional Clarity it also has six built-in microphones to monitor the outside environment plus adaptive noise cancellation settings that can be controlled through the Bowers and Wilkins app the battery life of the px7s2 is impressive with up to 30 hours of Maximum battery life upon a two hour charge or 7 hours of battery life when charged for just 15 minutes and its sound stages wide and close it offers good surround sound as well as an immersive experience even with ANC mode on delivering high quality detail at all times although they are more expensive than other headphones on the market they're worth it if you want a hassle-free listening experience with excellent Fidelity and Clarity if you can afford this Beast we say go for it finally we present to you the best overall headphones available on the market in 2023 Sony has always been top-notch when it comes to its Flagship ANC headphones the xm5s are a significant departure from Sony's typical design language for the wh-1000xm series they have this new shape that looks pretty minimal crisp and clean compared to the xm4 they have a thinner more rounded headband the headphones are also more minimalistic and very comfortable they lean more towards the design of the Bose 700 and airpods Max which isn't necessarily a bad thing first notice how light they are when you pick them up weighing in at 250 grams the xm5s are lightweight and Incredibly comfortable to wear in the head discreet memory foam ear cups are contoured to the shape of the head and fit comfortably around the ears the Earth sensor stops the music when you take off the headphones they automatically turn off to save battery power if they've been off for a while there is also an option to let ambient noise pass by placing your hand over the right ear cup despite active noise cancellation being the main feature the vh1000xm5 has some really cool smart features that further enhance the listening experience let's start with the location knowledge the headphones can learn your daily routine and Ambient sound control settings can be adjusted based on your location when paired with the smartphone when headphones detect that you're at home they can reduce the noise cancellation compared to when you're at the office if you go for a walk it can play more outside sound to keep you safe when crossing the street another great smart feature is speak to chat as the name suggests if you start a conversation while listening to the headphones you can talk without taking them off furthermore you can connect to two devices simultaneously and switch between them depending on what's happening on each for example to prioritize a notification finally there is better support for voice assistance Alexa and Google Assistant can be activated hands-free using the appropriate activation commands Sony has increased the number of microphones on the xm5 from 4 to 8 as for the sound it's rich and Lively sound profile emphasizes both high and low frequencies resulting in truly beautiful sound that is a pleasure to listen to even the subtlest nuances are easily heard thanks to the rich detail and the treble the lower frequencies sound tight and Punchy without being overdone or muddy overall this model delivers premium performance at the best possible price quality ratio you wanted the best you got it so that's it for the top 5 best headphones in

Can Buy! (In-Depth)\", \"video_id\": \"W0tGO9RIjjg\", \"transcript\": \"thank you welcome to the ovary headphones Awards where for the past few months I've been doing some in-depth testing on as many different pairs as I could to narrow down a list of the best wireless headphones you can buy of course everyone has different priorities when it comes to headphones and the term best can vary depending on what you want from your headphones for some that's the noise canceling performance for others is the call Quality or comfort and for many it's simply the sound quality so I tested each of them against each other in a series of tests to determine the winners in each of these categories before finally narrowing down a top seven so as we go through the video I'll give you a review of each of these headphones highlighting the areas they perform well and not so well in I'll show you the final rankings at the end so we can see the winners in each category and from this we can determine the overall performance of each one which will not only give us our ultimate winner but should also help you to see which of these headphones best suits your particular needs there's obviously a lot to cover here and it's taken weeks of testing to get to this point so without further Ado let's take a look at the headphones awards for 2023 we'll start things off with the new Bose quiet Comfort SE which is essentially exactly the same as the qc45s the only differences are a sled color change and a redesigned carry case this is actually the only soft carry case in this video the essay even appears as the 45s when you connect to the app just in case there was any doubt that the two models are the same interestingly Bose confirmed to me that the SC isn't a replacement for the 45s and is to launch alongside them instead confusingly at a lower price point right now for those wondering about the Bose nc700 they were a contender but with the SE having Superior battery life noise canceling sound quality and comfort these were the better choice with the SE the build quality and basic design aren't as premium or aesthetically pleasing as some of her other entries the button controls are a little mushy and bunch closely together there's no wearing detection and these use the less common two and a half millimeter port for the aux cable but the clue isn't the name as to why these make this list Bose's quiet Comfort headphones are both fantastic and noise canceling and super comfortable to wear for long periods of time these are the lightest pair of headphones in this entire video and pairing this with spacious earcups and an ultra low clamping Force these are one of the best pairs you can buy for long listening sessions with this design the relatively thin headband and ear cup padding is actually plenty and has the added benefit of not causing your ears to warm up too much but surprisingly these take second place for comfort and we'll see which entry beats these later so that's the Comfort aspect and as for the quiet part well these have amazing noise canceling performance and beat all of the other competitors for ANC simply put these are the strongest noise canceling headphones you can buy right now so with a foldable design in excellent Comfort these are one of the best options you can get for traveling especially long-haul flights so that alone is enough to make lots of people buy these but let's take a look at where these didn't perform so well firstly the my quality was one of the poorest here he's letting quite a lot of the background noise and my voice wasn't especially clear those do have the useful self-voice feature so you can adjust how much of your own voice you want to hear on a call it's in a noisy environment these headphones struggle to isolate your voice 's companion app is super clean but also fairly limited for instance despite being the most powerful you can't adjust the level of noise cancellation incidentally customization was the main area I found the nc700 to be better but here it's either full ANC or in transparency mode which by the way isn't anywhere near as good as the ANC possibly as a result of not being able to switch these to off mode the battery life is the poorest in this video at just 24 hours there's also no Google Fast pair or high-end codecs it's SBC or AAC only but like every entry in this video These do offer multi-points so you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch over by pausing on one and playing on the other with the sound quality this was one of the easier aspects to rank because although the sound quality is good here these are a noticeable step down in quality compared to the others Bose has quite a unique sound signature where the mids and vocals are pushed forward and the bass is quite tame it's a tuning that could be great for podcasts and is unlikely to fatigue your ears but the clarity and instrument separation is lacking and increasing the volume to compensate for the lack of bass the high-end frequencies can become harsh Bose's basic equalizer only lets you offset this slightly and I think overall with the lack of any high-end codecs these are one of the weaker performers when it comes to sound quality casual listeners will find these okay but audio files should stay clear so that fantastic noise cancellation and comfort does come with some trade-offs but the price is not one of them because these are the cheapest entry in this video the new SE model aren't quite appearing on the US Bose site yet but the 45s are down to 249 and I've even seen this as low as 189 pounds in the UK okay the next entry is the master and dynamic mw75 this time we get a rather large hard shell carry case covered in felds which isn't my favorite design but does keep the headphones protected these are packed with accessories including nylon braided USB C2C and USB to three and a half millimeter cables a quarter inch adapter a USBC to a adapter and an airplane adapter all neatly stored inside the case immediately you notice the big step up in terms of build quality and design these are one of the three what I'd call Luxury models in this video they're made of anodized aluminum glass and lambskin leather so they're no good if you're avoiding animal products but the materials contribute to an undeniably premium aesthetic the overall construction feels really solid it's just a shame these don't fall down for easier transport button controls are tactile but a bit on the small side and again bunch too close together you can easily power these off by mistake when reaching for the ANC button we do at least have wearing detection here though it was a bit inconsistent with these they won't Auto resume if you leave them paused for any more than a few seconds interestingly the usb-c port serves as both the charging port and the connection for Wired listening there's no AUX port on the headphones at all the trade-off with this premium materials is weights and therefore Comforts these are the heaviest headphones in this list at 338 grams and you really feel it the clamping force is reasonable but I find the ear cups are too small you have to maneuver these back and forth until your rears finally fit inside and there's not much room to breathe either the relatively firm but thick padding does help and I can still comfortably wear these for a few hours but they're placed in seventh for Comfort overall the 75s don't boast much in terms of features the app is rather basic hosting a handful of preset equalizers but disappointingly no custom EQ toggles for the audio prompt wearing detection feature and the auto power off and some options for the ANC mode but that's essentially it so it's not an app you really need to revisit in terms of the actual noise canceling performance these are just about on the right side of average the same as with the transparency mode and the rankings reflect this too ANC suddenly helps in a noisy environment but these don't perform to the level one might hope the headphones or the price tag this large attached plus these come with a quiet hiss with ANC turned on you at least get some more options here such as adaptive mode and you can turn off ANC to save on battery too you get 28 hours of listening with ANC so that's just above bows and puts these in sixth place one surprisingly good aspect is the cool quality these do a really decent job even in noisy environments and isolate my voice well on phone calls good enough to award these third plays for the microphone quality there's no Google Fast pair again but we do have much better codec choices with support for aptx adaptive which of course means higher quality streaming too these also offer multi-points and Bluetooth 5.1 but otherwise things are catch pretty simple second only to the design in terms of strengths is the sound quality with the mw75s we're entering the audiophile territory with an impressively wide Sound Stage bright treble but a fairly neutral overall presentation the step up and quality from Bose is immediately apparent with a far richer and more expansive and detailed sound the base here brings so much more body to your music which just starts to Boom ever so slightly especially at higher volumes and can encroach on the mids that's really the main quality that keeps these away from the top spot still these sound excellent over Bluetooth and you can even unlock 24 bit 96 kilohertz audio with wired listening through USBC but with sound quality or rather sound preference being so subjective the lack of a custom equalizer does let these down these can also reach pretty high volume levels but those smaller cups don't give the tightest acoustic seal to minimize sound leakage for which these ranked only six M D's mw75 are a stylish premium level pair of headphones with awesome sound that are surprisingly good for phone calls there are four stunning color options to choose from but that design is really going to have to pull most of the weight in justifying the high price tag these retail for 599 or 549 pounds next up is Apple's airpods Max just kidding these are overpriced uncomfortable and with so many of the best features being exclusive to iOS they're only a top 7 pair for Apple users next up is actually sennheiser's momentum 4. these come with a hard shell carry case these is a tough fabric exterior a design will see similar variations of later as well elastic straps hold down the USB a to c charging cable a two and a half to three and a half millimeter right angled alt cable so these also use the smaller two and a half millimeter ports an airplane adapter and there's a mesh pouch inside too with the paperwork the momentum 4S are unique in the use of fabric on the headband which looks and feels great and is paired with an otherwise quite simple design with a matte black plastic ear cups the design is something these get criticized for because of the move towards a more modern but generic style compared to the momentum threes that no longer folds down however I personally prefer that these don't use real leather I actually think they look much better now and the new lighter design greatly improves Comfort these use large deep and thick padded ear cups and although the headband padding is much thinner they didn't really cause any soreness there the only potential Comfort issue is the clamping Force which isn't bad necessarily but these are the tightest feeling headphones in this video and consequently there's only scored fifth place for comfort something I quite like though is that the ear cups rotate flat in both directions which is really useful whether you want to hang these around your neck or set them down on your desk you'll find only one physical button here which is used for power Bluetooth pairing battery info and summoning your voice assistant otherwise we have perhaps the most responsive and intuitive touch control system in this video we get all of the regulars for volume and skipping tracks but also extras like pinching to adjust the level of ANC or transparency the wearing detection is also super responsive and can even automatically power on the headphones when you put them on and place calls on hold when you take them off the any control downsides are one no hands-free voice assistant and two the multi-point isn't the most efficient or reliable if you don't pause on the first device before trying to play on the other your music will just play Into The Ether possibly without you knowing sometimes when these couldn't find the second device they would repeatedly interrupt to let me know this with a voice prompt and I did sometimes have connection issues when using two devices at once so there is multi-point but it wasn't the most seamless experience sennheiser's companion app is really good the interface looks great and you're offered good customization over the sound including custom and even personalized equalizers control over the ANC and transparency level including adaptive and wind noise reduction modes and you can even set location-based profiles with custom ANC and sound settings the noise canceling and transparency are the weakest aspects of these headphones the momentum 4 was ranked in seven for both neither is bad and in the real world you'll find both will serve you well in everyday situations but there's quite a substantial gap between these and the likes of Sony and Bose that's worth considering if noise canceling is one of your priorities the same can be said for the call Quality too which was pretty good but there are certainly better options and there's any rate in fifth my voice was usually intelligible on calls even in noisy environments and these have the useful side tone feature so you can adjust how much of your own voice is heard but I find this letting quite a lot of the background noise which can make you harder to hear these are for Bluetooth 5.2 a great codex selection including aptex adaptive and can even play audio via USBC the standout feature is the battery life as these offer a huge 60 hours and that's with ANC turned on this dwarves the competition and comfortably Awards Sennheiser first place for battery life another major strength unsurprisingly is the sound quality these right in third here but the competition for second place was extremely close and will largely come down to your personal preference there was a much bigger Step Up in quality with our sound quality winners but as one of our cheaper entries I'd also say that the momentum Falls offer the best sound quality to price ratio sennheiser's signature open rich and crisp sound is suitable for all genres and volumes we're not quite at audiophile levels in terms of neutrality to my ears there's a slight v-shape boosting the bass and treble but not to the typical overemphasized levels we're used to the separation remains clear and distinct and these are for a well detailed and refined sound this creates a sound signature that I expect will greatly appeal to the masses so even if you don't delve into The Equalizer settings to fine-tune these you'll likely really enjoy the out of the box experience you can crank up the volume and bass if you choose and the plush padding and firm clamping Force keep the sound leakage relatively low which may be useful to know for those looking to not disturb others around them the momentum fours don't offer the most premium design or the best noise canceling performance but they do have a fantastic control scheme amazing battery life and the best sound quality you can get without extending Beyond a 400 price tag they're available for 349 or 299 pounds just before we go on I want to quickly tell you about today's sponsor nordvpn you guys know what a VPN is and I've personally used a bunch of them before but have been particularly impressed with how seamless the Nord experience has been just one tab I'm connected actually that's not true because I use the auto connect feature so I don't even have to do anything I'm essentially just using the internet exactly as I normally would except now I have the benefits of online privacy and security my real IP address and location are hidden I have threat protection from trackers and malware and I can bypass geo-restricted content no matter where I'm traveling I'm currently using it across all of my devices and I just like that one it's actually fast so I get those benefits without a drop in connection speed and two the app interface is great that's something I'm especially enjoying with Nord at the moment so if you want secure and private access to the internet then I'd highly recommend nordvpn they've been kind enough to give me a discount code to offer you guys as well so I'll leave that down in the video description and as a pinned comment now for the entry that's probably the least expected and least well known in Technics eah 800 those of you who watch the earbuds Awards this year know that the Technics earbuds also scored very well you get a leatherette style hard shell case here along with a USB a to c charging cable a right angled aux cable and an airplane adapter now these are the headphones with the least exciting design they don't really use premium materials and the build quality isn't amazing but they score surprisingly well in lots of other categories immediately one redeeming feature is the folding design for easy travel which seems to be becoming less common now they use a hybrid of both physical buttons for the majority of the controls and a very sensitive touchpad which is more limited in its function and reserved just for some ANC and phone call Related controls the buttons are a bit too close together for my liking but overall the controls are fine there's also wearing detection though it can be a little slow but we do get hands-free Alexa integration though sadly not the Google Assistant Comfort is excellent with these and they tick pretty much every Box large spacious ear cups thick padding for the ear cups and headband and a very low clamping Force make these comfortable to wear for hours at a time these aren't the lightest headphones in this video but that's essentially the only reason these place in third for comfort the Technics app experience is simple enough provided you stick to the main two tabs where you'll find lots of customization over the ANC and transparency level and also the sound quality including custom and preset equalizers the settings tab can be a bit overwhelming with a long list of features and settings to customize so there are lots of ways to personalize these headphones but actually most of these settings you can set once and then just ignore connectivity is a major strength we have Bluetooth 5.2 Google Fast pair for quick setup on Android and location tracking and the SBC AAC and ldac codecs so no app text here but there are arguments as to whether ldac the technically higher quality codec is preferred over aptx adaptive the more flexible stable and less power hungry option the best feature though is the multi-point because not all multi-point is created equally you don't need to pause on the first device before switching over you can simply Tap Play on the other device and the sound immediately switches over automatically causing the audio on the first device for you it's extremely satisfying to use and even reconnecting to both devices after powering on the headphones is very fast it's multi-point done right you can also use ldac and multi-point at the same time I mentioned that since it's often the case that they're mutually exclusive battery life here is also excellent at 50 hours with ANC turned on so these are the only other pair that even come close to Sennheiser and there's quite a gap between these and a third placed entry another strong point is the mic quality these are quite an aggressive cancellation of the background noise a setting you can actually increase in the app which works very well in noisy environments but can sometimes clip or buffer your voice generally though these are a great option for phone calls and secured second place for my quality strong mic performance is usually a good indicator for ANC performance and the noise cancellation was indeed really good these do a really good job of blocking out the outside noise and also naturally amplifying it with transparency mode there's great customization over how strong each of these are as well and I like that you can cycle between all three modes with the touch pads my only complaint is that the initial setup for ANC is confusing and it's not clear how exactly it's changing the performance it's not intuitive that the ANC sounded best here these ranked in third overall for both categories but I do feel like there's a noticeable step up with our first and second place entries especially for ANC after a great showing in the sound quality category for Technics earbuds earlier this year I was optimistic about the headphones performance too but the competition is stronger here and sixth place is no mean fees these sound noticeably better than our seventh place bows anyway the a800s offer the most distinct v-shaped EQ of the seven which makes for a consumer-friendly sound profile that will sound good to most people Straight Out of the Box audiophiles may be moaned the slightly booming bass that lacks the control of our higher placed entries and the boosted vocals and treble to compensate for this but it makes for a dynamic energetic and well detailed sound and you can really crank up the volume with these two the clarity is good here we can't quite match sennheiser's cleaner mid-range nor the depth and separation of the mw75 so as great as these sound I think they fall just shy of the audiophile classification these also scored well in the sound leakage test and would make a good choice for keeping your music to yourself the a800s retail for 349 or 299 pounds and whilst their main lack a premium design or a killer feature set to instantly draw you in they offer an undeniably strong overall performance with six second or third place finishes techniques go toe-to-toe with the big names and are well worth considering we'll move on now to the bows and Wilkins px8 these come in one of those tough fabric exterior hard shell cases but have a cool magnetic compartment inside to hold the USBC to C and USB to three and a half millimeter cables like M D's mw75 these are another of the luxury models and the build quality here is simply outstanding from the stitching on the Napa leather to the cast aluminum arms these look and feel extremely high quality the extension on the headband and the rotation of the earcups is satisfyingly smooth and there's some resistance here too which adds to the premium aesthetic so although a non-vegan option is take a clear first place for build quality and look fantastic too these don't fold down for easier travel sadly but like sennheiser's headphones the ear cups rotate flat in both directions those materials do contribute to a relatively High weight though and with a reasonably firm clamping Force they're not as comfortable for longer listening sessions as some of the lighter models fortunately the ear cups are large and spacious and the padding on both the headband and ear cups is very thick and plush so I can still wear these comfortably for hours the px8s are a great example of physical buttons done right they're large and tactile and actually easy to distinguish thanks to the ridge center button they feel great to press these do come with wearing detection although it was a little bit slow even when you set the sensitivity to be high you don't get much in terms of customization either the left side button can either be the ANC mode or The Voice Assistant it seems strange to me that BMW don't even offer a double press option for something else surely that could easily be added through an update these do offer multi-point though and I'm pleased to say that it works like Technics does so pressing play on the other device immediately switches over the audio Source it's awesome connectivity in general was a mixed bag we get Bluetooth 5.2 and great codec choices including aptex adaptive but there's no Google Fast pair and for some strange reason I couldn't get the audio working via USBC there's no AUX port on the headphones so this is actually the only wired option I'm waiting to hear back from BMW about this since there are others reporting this too but for now these don't seem to offer a wired listening option so that's potentially an issue if these run out of battery life which incidentally will happen after 30 hours of playback so that's pretty much on par with the industry standard the overall feature set here is very light you can see in the app there's not much beyond the ANC mode a very basic equalizer for just the bass and treble and a couple of toggles for wearing detection and the auto power off the noise cancellation overall was one of the weaker aspects a step up from Sennheiser and still fairly good but lacking behind the performance of Sony and Bows they definitely take out a lot of the low end frequencies but have little effect on the others beyond what they passively block out In fairness this is a good amount thanks to the Great Seal the ear cups form around your ears and this helps to keep the sound leakage very low as well interestingly the transparency mode was actually great it's Amplified with a bit of a hiss but does make your surroundings really clear after testing the ANC I wasn't too surprised to find that the mic quality also isn't great with these my voice was oddly quiet and slightly muffled so even though these do fairly well with isolating my voice in a noisy environment it can still be hard to hear for the caller so these take sixth place as former winners of the best sounding true wireless earbuds it's no surprise that BMW's over here headphones offer similarly great sound quality performance is offer an open and beautifully refined sound with an expansive Sound Stage the level of clarity and instrument separation in the mid-range in particular is extraordinary for a wireless pair of headphones there's a lot of depth and control over the bass although I'd say the treble isn't quite as crisp as what Sennheiser or M D are offering so I'd personally add a touch of treble to the default War Machine the lack of even a 5 band EQ may put off those who really like to fine-tune their headphones the px8s offer a wonderfully rich and precise audiophile pleasing sound There's A step above the vast majority of competitors I've only heard one pair that can actually beat these BMW's px8 have a clear focus on build quality design and the sound quality so these factors obviously rank at the top for many people and could justify the relatively very high price tag at 699 or 599 pounds others may be looking for a more well-rounded or customizable option but if you're looking for a classy pair with fantastic sound quality that's exactly what you get here the penultimate entry is the bang Olufsen h95 and before we get into it I know some of you will be wondering whether cheaper Ajax model weren't included instead the h95s are insanely expensive and it might appear that the HX model are the more appropriate to compare against the others but the truth is that in testing the 95s overall performed better and more importantly what the HX are good at the h95 take to the next level so the HX end up being still incredibly expensive but also not as good as the 95s they're awkwardly Stuck in the Middle it just felt to me that you're paying this much money for a reason and you can justify that for the 95s but not really the HX so that's why they've made the cards first of all just check out this insane aluminum carry case for the headphones and inside the nylon braided leather strapped USBC charging cable aux cable airplane adapter and even a microfiber cloth you open this case and everything just screams premium quality I mean these even smell good so the overall package is second to none in terms of luxury again we have smooth adjustments of the headband and reassuring resistance when rotating the earcups though not quite as smooth as with the px8 which just snatched the win for the overall build quality the 95s could have easily taken the top spot though with their titanium Fabric and genuine leather Construction again these are one to avoid for the animal lovers but the premium build an aesthetic are on a level you can only expect with such a high price tag these are one of the few especially luxury models that actually fold down one of the benefits over the HX though I can't say these are super travel friendly with that metal case which is just begging to be scratched the weakest aspect of these headphones is the comforts you don't get the largest ear cups here they're quite heavy and the padding is a bit on the thin side the clamping force is reasonably firm though not too tight and despite the materials used the weight is actually kept fairly low so those aren't really the issue it's more the soreness of the crown of your head which I find Creeps in after a few hours of listening what's most interesting about the design is the control scheme because we have a rotating dial on both earcups one side for the volume and the other for the ANC level select the Microsoft Surface headphones this gives you instant intuitive control over these and it works really well my only gripe is that they're kind of loose and they also turn infinitely rather than stopping at the extremes there is a gentle beep when you reach full ANC or transparency and the same with the volume extremes but I think some tactile or better audible feedback as you move over each increment would make this much more satisfying or better still to physically feel some resistance here would have been great and it just doesn't feel like the dials keeper but the otherwise Ultra Premium feel we also have a metal switch for the power and Bluetooth pairing a single button on the left for the voice assistant and the right ear cup has a touchpad for the usual play pause and skipping tracks it's responsive and works well one disappointment though there's no wearing detection feature wise the experience is pretty Bare Bones in the app you'll find a slider for the ANC level toggles for the Adaptive mode Windows reduction and the autopower feature and there are also some preset eqs and a custom mode which is very easy to use especially for those unfamiliar with equalizers but for headphones aimed at audio files I would have hoped for a bit more precise control over the sound the noise canceling and transparency here is fairly good but these are really only a middle of the pack performer and again there's quite a step up for the market leaders normally this wouldn't be so much of an issue but since these are so expensive one would hope for better performance like the others in this list they're still going to block out enough sound in most situations you'll find yourself in but don't expect great ANC or transparency here on the plus side the passive noise isolation is quite good thanks to a good seal forward with the ear cups and these actually offer the least sound leakage from any of the finalists in keeping with our theme of average ANC suggests average mic quality these were okay for phone calls they're not great they do a fairly good job of rejecting background noise which places them above Sennheiser in fourth for my quality the Revelation course still wasn't super loud or clear so these aren't great in noisy environments especially connectivity is interesting because we get Bluetooth 5.1 a good codex selection including aptx adaptive and support for both Google Fast pair and Microsoft Swift pair these also have multi-point sadly not the Super far switching multi-points you still have to pause on the first device beforehand and actually I did have some stuttering issues at first when switching over so that's an overall pretty good mix but sadly these don't play audio via USBC and even worse they don't work passively with the cable when the headphones are switched off so wired listening isn't an option for when the battery runs out these are the only headphones here for giving the px8s for now that aren't able to do this fortunately the battery life is really good you get 38 hours with ANC turned on which ranks these in third place but then we get to sound quality where these are really in A League of Their Own there were some comparisons that were very close to cool like Sennheiser vs m d but with the h95 it just felt like nothing else could match the clarity and precision over the sound what sets these apart from the rest and I do think these open up a sound quality gap over the others is how wide The Sound Stage is and how clear the instrument separation is listening with these I was hearing details and drags I'd never heard before and to me this feels like the most accurate representation of the original sound from any pair of bluetooth headphones I've tested the base here is so natural and well controlled in fact it might even seem underwhelming to an average consumer since the majority of headphones are bass boosted the only other potential drawback to mention is that these don't get super loud like most of the others either but there's no muddying of the other frequencies and when balanced with an open and clear mid-range and crisp treble this is a sound that true audio files will appreciate and this is what I mean about justifying the price of the h95s not everyone has nine hundred dollars to spend on Bluetooth headphones but if you want the very best sound quality then you can justify getting these so that let's face it ridiculous price tag is going to immediately alienate the majority of people and that's totally understandable especially when features like the mic quality and the noise cancellation don't justify it but there's a very clear Market which these headphones are aimed at and it's those looking for a luxury package and class leading sound quality and our final entry is for sure going to be the least surprising of all which is Sony's wh-1000x M5 and I have to hand it to Sony there are a lot of great things about these headphones I'll start with actually the packaging Sony is the only company bothering to use sustainable materials for the packaging tech companies it literally doesn't matter what the packaging looks like but choices like this really benefit the environment so well done Sony the charging case is another of those tough fabric exterior ones and inside like the px8 case there's a magnetic compartment for the accessories a USB AC charging cable and a right angled aux cable let's start with arguably the weakest aspect which is the design and build quality it seems strange calling this a weak aspect because actually it's still really good here it's just that we're dealing with the very best headphones on the market so the lack of Premium materials here places Sony in fifth for build quality the minimal matte black design is similar to previous iterations from Sony the big change this year is a shift towards a non-folding design with earcups that only rotate away from you so you trade some travel convenience for structural integrity I think the single most surprising result from the entire testing period was Sony's first place for Comfort I mentioned that one pair somehow beat Bose's quiet Comfort headphones and it turned out to be the mark fives these are super lightweight at 250 grams they have the biggest and most spacious ear cups of all and an ultra low clamping Force so they took every box the padding is actually reasonably thin but you simply don't need it to be any thicker with these and actually this helps with keeping ear warming to a minimum the only downside is that without a very tight seal there is a bit more sound leakage than most of the others but what you gain in Comfort is totally worth it and I can happily wear these for hours on end the controls we have two buttons on the left for power battery and Bluetooth pairing and the other for changing the ANC mode on the right ear cup there's a touchpad to the music controls which are all very responsive my personal favorite is quick attention where you can cover the right ear cup to temporarily lower the music volume and turn on transparency mode which is so useful if you only need to quickly hear your surroundings I don't know if Sony has patented this but it's mad that no one else seems to be doing it too these also offer speak to chats a similar but hands-free feature for automatic transparency which you can customize in the app there's also hands-free hey Google and Alexa integration built-in Spotify tab wiring detection multi-point it's clear the mark files take a deserved first place for the controls as well for connectivity we have Bluetooth 5.2 Google Fast pair and Microsoft Swift pair and the SBC AAC and ldot codecs so that's all good except that multi-point and Dell DAC can't be used at the same time which is why I made the point that you can do this with the Technics headphones you can keep listening passively by the aux cable when these run out of battery and these offer 30 hours of playback with ANC turned on so that's pretty much the industry standard now but only Awards only fifth place for battery it will likely come as no surprise to tell you to the mark 5's noise cancellation is fantastic somehow a step up from the also great Mark IVs and these block out a huge amount of external noise with no hissing sound either I mentioned the low clamping force and the lack of a super Tight Seal so this goes to show just how much work the ANC is doing these don't have to rely on passive noise isolation and can still be extremely comfortable whilst offering excellent ANC this only just beaten by Bose these two really are in A League of Their Own though when it comes to noise cancellation it's superb although Beau is a slightly more powerful at blocking out noise Sony's ANC is more advanced and has some advantages I mentioned quick attention and speak to chat already but there's also features like adaptive sound control which gives you automatic switching of custom ANC profiles based on either your movement or location Sony has been doing this for a while now and the feature is pretty well optimized the mark files have automatic NC optimization for the environment too including for air pressure changes so combined with the best Comfort there's actually no better pair for a long-haul flight or really any kind of travel one of the things I noticed when compared to Bose is the lack of the cabin pressure-like sensation when using ANC I feel it slightly with Bose's se but not at all with Sony's Mark 5S and finally the simple fact that I can easily turn Ambient sound off with these is a huge plus Bose forces you to use either ANC or transparency which drains the battery even if you don't need it so overall Sony could easily have taken the ANC award instead I should also mention that the transparency mode is excellent the best in this video there is a tiny hiss so it isn't perfect but you do get the clearest amplification of your surroundings with these and you're able to adjust the transparency level in the app based on that ANC and transparency performance it came as no surprise that the mark 5's my quality was excellent but what did surprise me was how much better it was than the mark IVs and the rest of the competition these take first place by a big margin no other headphones can compete with the volume and Clarity of my voice and it could even use these for calls in noisy environments I think the main aspect letting these headphones down is the sound quality Sony still has a warm bass focused sound signature that's lacking the detail precision and accuracy of the market leaders the bass is actually Tighter and more controlled than the previous Mark IVs this is the best sound Sony has offered and there's more control than say Technics headphones there's a lot of depth and volume with the sound too loads of customization with the mini preset or custom equalizers and even an albeit limited spatial audio feature but there's still an emphasis on the low end and the rolled off treble though Pleasant sounding and free from any harsh sibilance is lacking that sharpness and detail that would balance out the sound again it seems strange talking about sound quality as a sort of weakness because if you're not an audio file then any one of these with the exception of Bose perhaps is going to sound really good of all the hundreds of ANC headphones on the market these still sound comparatively fantastic and lots of people actually like Sony's base Focus tuning but an audio file listening to these and then switching to the px8s or the h95s will instantly notice that step up and quality in particular with regards to balance and clarity Sony's wh-1000xm5 are clearly an extremely well-rounded pair of headphones with a great feature set 349 or 299 pounds they undercut those premium Alternatives that offer Superior sound quality but also beaten for Comfort controls and the ANC and mic performance they're certainly an attractive all-rounder and comfortably make it into this year's headphones Awards okay so we covered a lot of information there but let's break down what all of it means first of all here are the final rankings for all seven pairs of headphones you can immediately pick out the strengths and weaknesses for each one you may notice now that the order I review them in was from worst to best according to their overall performance bows in 7th and Sony in first Sony not only scored the best all-round performance but also the highest number of wins with four statistically it is by far the overall winner and the best pair of bluetooth headphones you can buy right now but everyone has their own specific factors that they prioritize for instance if you want the best sounding headphones then Sony may be no good and the same if you want one of the more luxury models with a premium build quality so you may be looking more towards bno or bows and Wilkins but you should factor in that there's a comfort versus luxury trade-off the top three most comfortable pairs were actually 5th 6th and seventh in build quality but even if there was an objective winner that doesn't mean that it's your winner equally seventh doesn't mean bad it just means not as good as the other six in some cases only very slightly Bose's SE scored the most Seventh Place finishes for instance but if your priorities and noise canceling and comfort then they may be your winner anyway most of us will have to take price into consideration too and actually if you look at the cost adjusted table you'll see changes like the h95s drop from second into sixth and Bose move up from Seventh into fourth once again though Sony's m5s are still the overall winner after factoring in the price and to throw my two cents in I would pick Sony's m5s on a personal level as well they still sound good enough for me and if I really wanted true audiophile level sound quality then I wouldn't be looking at Bluetooth headphones they would be my recommendation to most people and hopefully you can now see why in fact they're so good that even the previous mark IV share most of the same great features you should be able to find those now at an even cheaper price obviously I couldn't go into Super in-depth detail on each model here so as to keep the video concise at ham over 30 minutes but hopefully this breakdown has been helpful and if so then please drop a like to let me know if you have any questions about these

But somehow during those price drops it's somehow depreciated in value? I could see an argument for that you had other headphones on there with better qualities at similar prices, but you don't.

The positives however are that the connection is much easier to manage, the Sony's used to be a pain to get to sync to multiple devices, the AirPods Max are much better in that regard. I'm sure that's mostly the H1 chip and using Apple devices but it's so much more pleasant not to fight Bluetooth to get them to connect. The AirPods Max are clearly designed to emulate the experience of AirPods, they don't have a powerbutton and are meant to be put back in the case after use, and then when removed from case are already connected to your device. They work well in that sense. Where it doesn't make sense though is that the 'smart' case you get is odd, it's not protective but it's also not small enough to pocket, so you end up buying a third party hard case for travelling and then for taking the headphones to work etc you don't take the smart case. The only positive is that the headphones left outside the case still go into their lower power states, but it's just slower to do so than it is in the case. Still, this is a very strange solution for a problem that would have been solved by just having a physical off button, as it is they drain a small amount of battery even if in the case. It feels like Apple being stubborn about maintaining the characteristics of 'AirPods' despite the over ear headphone category having different expectations. I have had issues with them being left a couple of days in the case and getting 'stuck' off and needing to be plugged in to 'revive' them, bizarre, and again, would have been solved with a physical power button. Overall however I like the sound quality and the fit and finish but think they only make sense for users who are 100% inside Apple's ecosystem. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/10951138983900455918/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7163760461206419354_0,pid:15492005766354181950,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSzf_cupH-AhV1MlkFHSgNDk0QqSQIdg\"}, {\"date\": \"October 7, 2022\", \"title\": \"Great headphones!

If you are looking for clear and balanced sound, these fit the bill. They feel solid in your hands (and heavy on the head) but comfortable to wear (at least for me) for a few hours. Noise cancellation is better than my Sony XM4. Digital crown dial and secondary button does the trick to play, pause, and toggle ANC (Sony did spoil me with the tapping of headset to play/pause but it's fine) Spatial audio is mind blowing and the convenience to easily connect to any Apple device - including the Apple TV is how you're rewarded for being a part of their ecosystem. Sony's way to pair only two devices simultaneously comes at a cost of lower bitrate of music. And if paired with an iPhone, when people call me, they tell me I sound great with little background noise. It is a bit of a head scratcher that they don't support the higher quality bitrate of music that Apple Music has in their library. Also, charging by lightning cable instead of USB-C is also a selfish decision on their part but the battery life is great. If you have a really large head, make a hard pass onto something else. If you want skull crushing bass response, go elsewhere. The bra/purse/case to allow it to go into very low power mode is not very attractive in my opinion. Thankfully there are 3rd party cases that now do the same thing and it protects it better when thrown in the backpack for travel. I got these headphone at a great price due to price matching (Amazon), BB rewards cash back, and a gift certificate I got for my b-day. Took the price way down below $300 (and it came included with 2 years of AppleCare). Considering next gen APM should be announced this year, the price of this model should go down and make it even more suitable for purchase.

I have and love the AirPod Pros for day-to-day with calls, music, audiobooks, and recently been using them on planes for work commuting more and more as the noise canceling is pretty good. I got these because they were on sale and my old pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I loved) were failing, so I figured I would buy these and worst case exchange for Sony headphones if these weren't worth the premium. I watched a lot of reviews, MKBHD had a review and I thought it seemed oversold on sound quality compared to what I thought was really good with the Sony options always, and I was initially underwhelmed and worried I would end up exchanging. Then I let them sit for a bit and settled in and used them for a day or two for my calls/video conferencing and music. I started to realize how much clarity I got without really losing anything. Instead of getting that punchy bass everywhere, you get bass that really acts as emphasis. Vocals are crystal clear. Mic quality is excellent. Comfort wise it is great over long periods. Noise canceling is at least as good (honestly seems better) than other headests I've had. Ambient mode is way better and doesn't have that harsh sound. Only knock on it is if you're doing anything active with them on I feel like the mesh cups do tend to absorb a bit more. The plastic backing makes it a little hard to clean but not impossible. They DO sell replacement ones, so I guess in the long run if it gets bad, it's replaceable. I do wonder the same about the headband material if it will get gross or stretched, but these first few weeks it's so comfortable I find reasons to reach for this headset over listening on other devices, just because I am liking it that much! \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/10951138983900455918/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7163760461206419354_0,pid:15492005766354181950,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSzf_cupH-AhV1MlkFHSgNDk0QqSQIdg\"}, {\"date\": \"April 3, 2022\", \"title\": \"Perfect for those in need of noise management\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"Leah · Review provided by bestbuy.com\", \"content\": \"I have been looking for good quality noise cancelling headphones to help me manage my hypersensitivities to sound. These have really good specs that help: noise cancelling function, transparency mode (that modulates sudden loud noises and mutes them down for you, even if you had noise cancelling turned off), a really good microphone for calls etc, and an incredibly durable frame with replaceable parts. The biggest downside I have found is that condensation builds inside of the headset very quickly. The headphones are not water resistant in any way, so this is troublesome if you have to wear for any length of time. If you remove the ear pad, the condensation looks like shiny black things around the components. The first time I saw it, I thought it may be some kind of adhesive. The common \\\"fixes\\\" found online are to avoid temperature disparities to prevent the metal casing from being a different temperature than the environment, don't use in humid places, and to let them dry out often. This basically means no one in any location can use them. Anywhere. Or wear them for anything more than 15-20 minutes at a go. I live in Alaska. Even used only inside, there are huge temperature differences that create condensation. The environment here is very dry, so that isn't a factor. Also, if you have a warm noggin, it'll condense. This is the biggest problem these headphones seem to have and I sincerely hope Apple makes them at least water resistant in the future because the build itself otherwise is a solid 10/10. The sound is also reaaaaally good for even those who are a bit more into how music sounds, let alone the average person's music needs. ALSO: these were purchased open-box from Best Buy. The condition was exactly as marked on the box. But they did have someone else paired to them (In their iCloud) and it wasn't removed prior to my purchasing them. I had to look up how to remove them from someone's account before I could pair them to my own setup. I'd recommend Best Buy look at that for other open-box resold items but beyond that, the experience and cost was great. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/10951138983900455918/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7163760461206419354_0,pid:15492005766354181950,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSzf_cupH-AhV1MlkFHSgNDk0QqSQIdg\"}, {\"date\": \"March 16, 2023\", \"title\": \"Pricey remote work headphones that work fantastic for calls\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"MICHELLE · Review provided by nfm.com\", \"content\": \"After seeing all the reviews and videos on the Air pods Max I decided to go with these instead of the Sony XM's because of the many reviews I saw of people feeling a lot of pressure on their head with ANC. I am very happy with my purchase because after the initial stretching of the headband, my air pods max are so comfy! The earcups are great for those who don't want to struggle with their hair getting stuck on the earcups as it just slide off! I have a small head and I feared that these would be too big/heavy for me but they are a great fit! For work I bought the Lightning to 3.5 mm Audio Cable for my work calls since my work laptop is not a Mac and it's great. I love using these in transparency mode as I can hear myself when I'm on work calls and also hear my surroundings when I am just listening to some music. They are VERY pricey but I see it as a great investment for remote work! I would opt to have these as just work headphones and MAYBE travel once in a while because of just how much space they take up with a third party case. (which I recommend buying because the one it comes with does not protect the mesh headband at all.) This isn't a NEED but if you are already considering spending the $400 for Sony or Bose headphones I would take a look at these in person before ruling them off. (Plus these go on sale sometimes so the difference between these and Sony/Bose goes from $150 to $80-$100.)

The Airpods Max are very comfortable for long periods of time. The audio quality is great and crystal clear. It has good bass but not great. The noise canceling does a good job at atopping unwanted noises from interrupting your listening experience. All around, it is a beat of a product. You cannot go wrong with it. I own the XM5’s and comparing the two, the aipods max are more comfortable but the Sony XM5’s provide a deeper and louder bass. The sony XM5’s provide SLIGHTLY better noise canceling and should not be the overall deciding factor between the two. As far as sound quality, the airpods max takes the cake. You hear very crystal clear notes and voices with the airpods max and you can tell by listening that they are expensive headphones. The XM5 sound quality is great as well but the airpods max sound quality is just that much more better. Build wise, the airpods max are built to last because of its hard outer shell. The airpods max dont have that hard enclosure but thy do have a headband that is very flexible and will not break from any regular wear and tear. Coming from someone who unbiasly has both, i prefer the airpods max and only gave it a 4 star rating for its slight lack of bass. The sony XM5’s have great bass but arent really comfortable to wear, more specifically, outer ear pain. The ear cup of the sony XM5’s are not as deep or as large as the airpods max. So even if you have small ears, the xm5’s earcups can squish up against your ear slightyl but within 20 minutes, that pain and discomfort will be enough for you to want to take them off. Both are quality products and both are winners in their own right. However,i prefer apples airpods max. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/10951138983900455918/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7163760461206419354_0,pid:15492005766354181950,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSzf_cupH-AhV1MlkFHSgNDk0QqSQIdg\"}, {\"date\": \"March 1, 2023\", \"title\": \"Great Noise Cancellation But Too HEFTY\", \"rating\": 4, \"source\": \"Niko · Review provided by bestbuy.com\", \"content\": \"Overall, I would recommend, but only if cost and weight are not deciding factors for you. TL;DR: Noise cancellation - Great! I had no idea my home and office were so loud until I tried these then took them off. Noise cancelling does have a few exceptions, like running water and other high frequency sounds like dish clanking. Sound - Quality is excellent, especially for streaming video. I used them wirelessly for conference calls; they can be wired as well with a lightning to aux cable. Weight - These are quite hefty compared to similar products, weighing in at around 40% heavier than the closest competitors. For me caused neck and upper back pain after only short periods of use (less than one hour). Design - I loved the mesh ear cups compared to other over ear products I've used. I found them comfortable, breathable, and safe for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. Price - These are immediately recognizable as an expensive item whereas competitor headphones are likely harder to recognize. This easy identification was a downside for me as I'd rather go with a set that is NOT such an obvious status symbol. Bottom Line: The hefty weight and hefty price...err, outweigh...the value for me. That said, if you are not concerned about the exorbitant cost or about putting your financial choices on display in such an obvious way, these are a great product for those embedded in the Apple ecosystem. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/10951138983900455918/reviews?q=apple+airpods+max&prds=eto:7163760461206419354_0,pid:15492005766354181950,rsk:PC_7069147378898153804&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSzf_cupH-AhV1MlkFHSgNDk0QqSQIdg\"}, {\"date\": \"March 21, 2023\", \"title\": \"Goodbye Beats\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"RoyP · Review provided by bestbuy.com\", \"content\": \"Its just a matter of team before Beats is fully phased out since no one buys them anymore. These AirPod Max have stolen the spotlight. They are very steep in price, but the build quality and sound that comes out of these, makes it worth it. Aside from the weight, the 9 microphones make these feel like you don't have them on - voices/outside sounds are that clear. If you wear glasses, these will hurt after a while from the pressure. After using these for a couple months (without glasses on), they don't hurt when I use them anymore. I guess I just have to position them a certain way where it doesn't make my head hurt. Do not workout in these since they are not water or sweat proof. If you do use them for the gym buy AppleCare so you can get a quick replacement if they stop working. The \\\"bra\\\" that the headphones come with is absolute junk. I'm surprised apple did not come up with a better solution. There are many sleep docks online that you can get for these and I do suggest you do that. Not only for ease of use but so you don't have use the original case and so you don't have to charge these every 1.5 days. With the sleep dock, I charge my headphone to 100% over the weekend, and by Friday, they are close to 10% left.

After all the hype and seeing these on sale, I picked up a pair of AirPods Max for $430 brand new with my Best Buy rewards. I have watched multiple YouTube videos and have done several A/B tests between the AirPods Max and my old but rugged and road ready Pioneer HDJ-2000 headphones The Pioneers did their job at multiple gigs and clubs, but the AirPods Max blows them away for sound quality. The low end you hear in movies is something you have to hear to believe. The soundstage that so many talk about is the best I have ever heard in a set of headphones. All that computational audio—akin to the computations Apple implements in iPhones to create great photos from very small camera sensors—just about makes bluetooth sound as best as it can.

They worked great for a couple weeks and then mysteriously developed a connection issue. They will pair with the AppleTV but lose connection every time you shift them on your ears. You can't lift one or both sides off without losing connection. I tried turning off head tracking but it's still the same result. I have to manually restart them to reconnect. Also, I can't pair them to anything other than an Apple product. It doesn't go into pairing mode when I hold the noise cancellation button like it's supposed to. I'm also experiencing battery drain issues while they're in the case. All these issues coincided with the current 4E71 firmware release in May-2022. Now it's mid-July and no new firmware has been released. They are basically useless and have been collecting dust for over two months now while I wait on the new firmware that might fix it. Surely I'm not the only person with these issues. Apple needs to fix this. Other than that, the sound was about the same as my Beats Studio or JBL 660NC headphones.

The design has definitely improved, and it feels sturdy despite the slimmer build. It folds flat, nice and compact in the equally sturdy case. There's USB-C support for charging, and it doesn't take too long to charge either -- but that's where the positives end. I'm a longtime fan of Sony headphones, but this pair is definitely my worst. Here's why: - The noise cancelling is really, really bad. I was patient and waited for Sony firmware updates, and while Sony did tweak some of the settings, none of the updates since June have done the headphones any good in terms of noise cancelling *quality*. Sure, the headphones can now automatically change noise cancelling intensity based on location and movement, but the changes are now so jarring and inconsistent, thus making the updates feel more like a massive downgrade. Here's a daily scenario: you walk to your bus stop, the headphones then switch to a different noise cancelling setting because it remembers that your local bus stop is a saved location (and if you haven't saved it, you'll receive an annoying amount of notifications for any of your regular locations, including any bus stops you're regularly at as part of your commute); you get on the bus, and the headphones change to a different noise cancelling intensity...but at every stop, your headphones think that you got off, so the automatic motion detection switches to \\\"walking mode\\\"...imagine this on a 10-stop bus commute, and the number of times your headphones switch from commuting-walking-commuting-walking-commuting... Then imagine the occasional stop because of traffic lights, the occasional roadwork, traffic... For some reason these headphones seem to think that \\\"commuting\\\" means \\\"non-stop fast travel from start to end\\\". Having to constantly tweak the settings on my commutes when I just want to relax and enjoy music or podcast or even just silence is definitely not a good start to the day. - These headphones will occasionally turn off for no reason. Sometimes they restart, sometimes they just turn off without restarting, adding to the endless list of disruptions that you can expect to experience while using these headphones. - It's great that you can easily control volume and playback by swiping on your earcups...so long as you don't rely on the option to connect two devices at a time -- a great feature, but one that often disables (for some odd reason) the ability to use gestures to control playback and volume. You'll never know when this happens, but I can assure you of this -- it *will* happen. - There's the option to use \\\"Spotify Tap\\\", with two open slots, both for the same feature (which is very odd): you can just switch from one Spotify playlist to another Spotify playlist...which one are you switching to? No idea, it just switches it to a random playlist...and I have no idea why this was added as a \\\"feature\\\". - Although Google Assistant is still advertised as a great feature for this pair...it's actually not available. Google have revoked this feature, and it's not even a new announcement, but for some reason Sony still advertises this as a selling point. - No worries if you still want to use a voice assistant function -- there's Alexa...which works...so long as you keep the app open...but if you have the app open on your phone, you may as well just use your phone while you're at it -- which leads me nicely to my final point: These headphones were not meant for you to listen to music or whatever form of entertainment you want to enjoy. These headphones were meant for you to use -- use the app to correct the frequent mistakes, constantly swipe across the earcups and press the buttons to fix the errors, regularly open the Sony app to tweak the settings of your noise cancellation, and hope that you won't have someone around you nudging you about how bad the sound is leaking from your headphones while the volume isn't even at 50%. These headphones are a huge step back for Sony -- sure, they packed a lot of innovation and great tech in it, but with the constant tinkering I've had to resort to these past few months, these headphones feel more like a really expensive gadget to with, and less like a pair of headphones. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:17599387104131483155_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjapqzdupH-AhVmElkFHZPwAiEQqSQIbA\"}, {\"date\": \"May 24, 2022\", \"title\": \"Unbelievable noise canceling! Excellent sound!\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"Mike · Review provided by bestbuy.com\", \"content\": \"If you're looking for the best active noise canceling, over-ear headphones... look no further! The quality of noise canceling is second to none, somehow, Sony has taken the best ANC headphones and improved the ANC! Okay, on to the review. The Sony WH-1000XM5s have amazing sound quality, a nice finish (the black does attract fingerprints, at least at first), very comfortable for extended wear, and easily adjustable. The only thing I wish would have been kept around is the ability to fold the headphones like the previous versions, the case for the XM5s is a bit bulky, but you can clip it to a backpack or slide it into a bag pretty easily. The case also holds an included USB-C charging cable and 3.5mm cable in a magnetically sealed compartment and covers the entirety of your high-end headphones, unlike some of Sony's competitors. The thinner headband is nice, I can't really speak to how it may affect one's hair, but it leaves a smaller headband imprint on my bald head and has a barely there feel to it. The earcups are very comfortable and have ample room, even for those with bigger ears! They retain some of the best features of Sony's other ANC headphones, such as: touch controls on the ear cup, cover-to-speak/hear ambient mode, ANC/Ambient/\\\"normal\\\" mode button, 3.5mm ability, highly adjustability in the Sony Headphones app, auto-mode switching based on activities. The ambient mode has the ability to focus on voices, instead of just the general ambient noise and the ability to adjust the level of the ambient noise let in is a very nice feature to have. Pairing that with the auto-mode switching and \\\"speak-to-chat,\\\" which switches the headphones to voice-focused ambient mode when you begin to speak and turns off after a predetermined (and adjustable) amount of time, make for an amazing set of headphones for working in the office, taking on flights, trains, busses, and walking around. Now, they are not claimed to be water or sweat-resistant or IP rated in any way, kind of a bummer on for headphones that seem as though they'd be a perfect pairing for running or working out, but most of the nicer headphones lack an IP rating. In my testing of them, they've held up to some pretty sweaty runs. I do dry them off immediately and leave them off and out of their case for about an hour afterwards and they look, sound, and function perfectly. Something that each individual will have to decide if they're willing to take that risk with such a nice set of headphones. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Sony WH-100XM5s to those looking for great audio quality for music, videos, and calls with amazing active noise cancelation for the times you wish to be isolated from outside noise. I could see these being a perfect fit for a frequent traveler, a music loving office worker looking to focus, and anyone who likes to head the world around them in excellent clarity while wearing their over-ear headphones! I am absolutely loving these and think they're worth the bump in price from the previous generation (XM4) by improving on the previous generation in all ways except for the ability to fold. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:17599387104131483155_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjapqzdupH-AhVmElkFHZPwAiEQqSQIbA\"}, {\"date\": \"December 3, 2022\", \"title\": \"Some stuff is good some stuff needs to be improved\", \"rating\": 4, \"source\": \"Rafacast7 · Review provided by sony.co.uk\", \"content\": \"The surface of the arch that fits your head is very thin, this looks good, but it makes it so that the point of contact in your head is minimal. Since only a small part of this surface touches your head, there is a lot of pressure on it, and after an hour, the top of my head starts hurting, and I have to move the ring around throughout the day to avoid this pain, which is very annoying. The headphone comes with sensors which detect if you have them on. It comes with an app where you can choose if to turn the headphones off when you take them off your head by using the sensor. This is amazing for saving batteries meaning you don't have to charge them often because you forgot to turn them off manually. The problem is you can choose a timer for the to turn off and turn off immediately after taking them off, making it very annoying when you want to take your headphones off for multiple reasons like going to the toilet, talking to someone else or simply moving them around to find a more comfortable position, they turn off and if you are in a meeting on slack or teams, skype you will have to go through the process of connecting a device to these apps again which is very annoying. On top of that, I like to put a hoodie on and the headphones on top simply because it makes me feel warm, but the sensor picks that I am not wearing the headphones properly and turns them off; this is super annoying too. The only solution is to turn the feature which turns the headphones off automatically and remember to turn them off manually myself which I always forget and end up having to charge them more often than I would like to. The solution would be to let us put a timer when they should turn off so I could conveniently set them up to turn after 5 minutes of having them off, but alternatively only allow them to turn off if there is no audio playing. This would make it so that I can take them off for short periods of time without having them turned off and so that I could wear them however I want them without turning them off as long as I am listening to music or on a call with someone else. The problem with the small contact point and the pain at the top of my head, well this is a design flaw and I do find myself not wearing them often on purpose if I don't have to due to the discomfort and instead play my laptop speakers. The noise cancelling and audio quality is superb and the ambient mode is decent. I have 10 days to keep them or return them, and I am leaning more towards returning them.

The absence of any quick start guide was frustrating since I didn't have great cell coverage at the time I unboxed the headphones. I didn't know about the controls on the side and the app does not offer any guide either. I am still left in a maze to navigate their website in and out of hyperlinks to figure out which button or surface space does what. For an extremely high price these headphones are less about quality sound and more about noise canceling. If you like great audio, these aren't the headphones for you as they muffle and distort the sound. In general, noise canceling does that so that isn't a complete surprise. An astonishing and ridiculous issue I have with these headphones is that you CANNOT USE THEM WHILE THEY CHARGE?! In this era of device demand, this is a shockingly ignorant choice on the part of Sony. I get it, they might think since wireless earbuds can't be used while charging then who needs to listen to their headphones while they charge? Or perhaps they prioritized a fast charge over listening. The problem with that comes when you quick charge devices over and over again for short periods of time ruining the battery performance. Sony is practically begging you to do that by discouraging you from being able to listen to them at the same time as fully charging them. Overall I appreciate being able to drown out a good amount of background noise but I am left questioning if that's really worth the $400 price tag. If you are looking for noise canceling, pick a pair of great sounding earbuds and skip the actual noise canceling feature, just purchase some flight line ear protection headphones for a much better comfort and outside noise control. You'll save yourself hundreds while having a much lighter pair of headphones that doesn't overheat your ears. Another disappointment of mine was the erroneous idea that connecting to two devices at the same time would mean I could actually listen to two inputs at the same time. Perhaps Bluetooth isn't there yet through no fault of Sony, but I also felt the advertising was misleading on this particular feature and the answer was buried in Bluetooth spec and tech sites and not disclosed on the Sony site. I like that my phone can interrupt my business meeting playing from my computer but I dislike that I cannot listen to ambient sound on Pandora while participating in a business meeting at the same time. Since the audio can't be independently adjusted in noise volume by your individually connected device, you are left with a ring tone set to the same volume as your YouTube video or conversely the YouTube video resumes as loudly as the call and that is mildly annoying. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:17599387104131483155_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjapqzdupH-AhVmElkFHZPwAiEQqSQIbA\"}, {\"date\": \"June 1, 2022\", \"title\": \"Great upgrade to an already great product\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"GrenA · Review provided by sony.co.uk\", \"content\": \"I purchased my first noise cancelling headphones in 2017 and, after a significant amount of research decided on the MDR-1000X. I have been extremely happy with the quality of these products to the extent that I then purchased my wife a pair of WH-1000XM3, the upgraded version of my headphones in 2019. We were both extremely happy with the design, comfort, ease of use and quality of the products. The main reason for purchasing them was for travelling, and making long-haul flights more enjoyable without the distraction of the plane and other background noises. The WH-1000XM5 are, however, a significant step up from these previous products. Firstly, the headphones feel significantly lighter, which is always a plus for travelling. The previous versions used to fold away into their carry case with a bit of twisting, which I always was worried about in case of getting it wrong, having to double check each time that I folded the correct ear. To be fair, it was easy enough, but with this pair, there is no need for this and they simply fold flat back into their case, which makes easier The carry case is a bit bigger, which therefore takes a bit more room in your hand luggage, but has room within it for all cabling (audio and charger), which is a good. I actually think the latest version are more comfortable as well - but it is marginal. I always felt noise cancelling was great on the previous product and it is equally so on the new version. The big plus for me is that there is now no need to run the noise cancelling optimiser for different surroundings. OK, it was fairly simple by pressing a button, but it took about a minute to complete. There is no need for this with the XM5's, as apparently they auto optimise based on your surroundings - which is great. There are other new features that you have to get used to: - the headphones automatically pause what you were listening to when you take them off, and restart when you put them back on - confusing at first when testing, when you think you must have pressed something by accident, but it is a feature which is quite useful - similarly, if you start speaking, the headphones recognise this, pause your music and switch to ambient mode so you can hear - ideal for when you are asked if you want a drink on the plane! Apparently you can pair the headphones to 2 devices simultaneously, in case you are listening to music on a laptop but want to still receive calls!? That is not really relevant for me, so I have not tried it. Battery life is claimed at 30 hours and a 10 minute charge apparently provides 5 hours of battery use. Again, I cannot validate these figures - but have not experienced any issues. In short, they charge quickly and last a long time! Sound quality is pretty important when buying headphones and this is where they come into their own, and I personally think they offer a much fuller sound than my original 1000X, with impressive bass. They are a real step up. In summary, these are really excellent headphones from every perspective and I was pleasantly surprised at how they improved on what I previously thought were perfectly adequate 1000X. I am very happy that I have the new ones, especially as now we can fly again so hopefully I will get chance to use them more often. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:17599387104131483155_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjapqzdupH-AhVmElkFHZPwAiEQqSQIbA\"}, {\"date\": \"May 27, 2022\", \"title\": \"The BEST just got BETTER!\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"mstanleynh · Review provided by bestbuy.com\", \"content\": \"Sony has done it yet again; they’ve actually improved upon what I feel are the BEST noise cancelling wireless over-ear headphones available! The WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are the newly released version from Sony and they have added even more user-friendly features and technology than the previous versions…and updated the look to a more modern design. What’s in the box - The headphones ship with a great zippered carrying case, a USB-C fast charging cable, an audio cable for wired connection and instructions/paperwork/360 Music offer. The headphones fold much easier compared to the previous versions. There is no more origami-like folding, just turn the ear cups and put them in the case…which is a good size for traveling. They fit perfectly in the outside pocket of my backpack. The earphones were fully charged out of the box, so all that’s needed to get started (optional really, as they headphones will connect to your Bluetooth device anyway) is download the Sony Headphones Connect app and set up the earphones. There was a software update available for the headphones and it updated once they were connected. Fit and Function - The first thing I noticed was the new sleeker, more modern looking and lighter design of the XM5s. Although the design has changed, the comfort level is as plush and comfortable as ever. The ear cups and headband are super plush and easy to adjust to your head size. I've been wearing them almost non-stop for the last couple of days and there are no hotspots or uncomfortable rubbing. Hold the power button for a couple of seconds and then the magic starts, the noise canceling technology is fantastic, literally cutting out all the background noise as I mowed the lawn, went running or just listening to music while working around the house (my wife texts me as I can't hear her!). With the Auto Switching Based on Action, the noise cancelling level adjusts to your activity and the outside noise. Sound Quality - The sound quality is the BEST I've ever heard from Bluetooth NC headphones. Straight out of the box these things rock, but the Headphone Connect app gives the user the ability to set custom preferences for sound and services. From a noise canceling perspective Sony touts 8 total microphones and a newly designed 30mm driver to provide optimized noise canceling performance. So the 1000XM5s provide industry leading noise canceling and music that is so crisp and clear on the highs and the bass is rich and deep. Quality sound as expected from Sony! Headphone Connect App - it's a great tool for taking advantage of the many settings these headphones provide like Adaptive Sound Control, Noise Canceling Optimizer, Surround, Equalizer, Sound Quality Mode, Voice Assist, etc. Open the app, turn on the headphones and hold them close to connect and you’re ready to customize the earphones. The app is broken into four sections: Status, Sound. System and Services. Some of the functions are automatic like the Adaptive Sound Control - this will detect your surroundings and adjust the headphones accordingly. You can also select the Noise Canceling levels. The System tab is all about the operational settings like Auto Power Off, Touch Sensors, etc. Super easy to use and a great tool that’s very well laid out for the user. Cool (and totally useful) Functions - Not only do these headphones rock, they are loaded with super cool and totally useful Touch Features so you can adjust the music level, FF, Pause, answer phone calls, etc. by simply touching the right ear cup. And if that isn't enough, Sony has upped the game by adding Speak-To-Chat which stops the music and let’s in ambient sound so you can hold a conversation without having to take the earphones off or cover the right earphone (which still works) as the previous version supported. The other new function that really stands out to me is the Automatic Off (Wearing Detection) feature. By simply taking the headphones off, music is instantly paused until they are put back on…then the music instantly starts up again automatically. Not sure how Sony will add more features to these headphones in the future…but I’m sure they will do something amazing! Phone Calls – Sound is great both on the speaker and headphone sides. No complaints from anyone I’ve talked to on the headphones. Your music will start right back up once the call is ended. Totally hands free and couldn’t be any easier to use! Battery Life - As mentioned, they came fully charged and after multiple days of use, they are still at 60%...this absolutely crushes the battery performance of my other NC headphones. And on top of that, there’s a quick charge feature that adds 3 hours of charge in just 3 minutes. Worrying about battery life is completely off the table based on my experience to date. Pros: - Noise Canceling and Sound Quality are second to none - Support for connecting to 2 different devices simultaneously - Ease of adjustability of sound and functions - Touch & Automatic Controls - control your music, pause or call without ever touching your phone - Fit and comfort is outstanding, even after hours of use – no hot spots - Sony’s Headphone Connect App give the user complete control over setup and functionality of headphones - Taking Phone Calls - crisp and clear even in a crowded room - Recycled packaging is a nod to the environment by Sony Cons: - The new case is a bit larger than in the past, not a huge issue, but something that stood out The Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are by far one of my new favorite devices and would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for the BEST noise canceling and function-packed over-the-ear headphones available. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:17599387104131483155_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjapqzdupH-AhVmElkFHZPwAiEQqSQIbA\"}, {\"date\": \"May 30, 2022\", \"title\": \"These might just be as good as it gets..........\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"occasionalstan · Review provided by sony.co.uk\", \"content\": \"Ok, these are the first 'over the head' high quality wireless headphones I have used and I have to say they have set the bar really high. I have some top end wired Sony Hi Res headphones with no noise cancelling along with some competitors wired noise cancelling headphones and these beauties are on par if not better than both. Firstly the aesthetics are very good, you receive them in a Sony blended material box that might be completely recycled but has a nice solid feel to it and looks nice. Then, when you open up inside is the carry case which may be a bit thicker than I'd like but I'm happy to live with it as it keeps the contents safe. The first view of the WH-1000XM5 is impressive, nice matt finish with classy leather essentials that are very very comfortable indeed and I didn't find my ears getting too hot after 4 hours of continual wear. I'm not sure about all day comfortable but I don't think I could wear any headphones all day. The side panel with all the little tweaks and tricks is a joy to use after looking at the accompanying guide and very quickly becomes intuitive. This is very cleverly done and it seems they were developed with someone who has a similar brain to me because they just work. The sound is really really good with full range and depth, I don't know if I'm imagining it but feel it's not quite as expansive as when they are plugged in via the included cable, that being said Marvin Gaye singing Mercy Mercy Me in Hi Res on my Xperia 5ii is absolutely sublime with all the layers coming through nicely and Marvins smooth voice an utter joy. The noise cancelling is really effective and again the handy side panel enabling you to just hold it to hear is so handy. It makes you feel like it is just you and the music which is exactly what I want. I have used the 360 audio before with other Sony headphones and I have to say these seem to get a bit more out of the separation truly surrounding you with glorious sound. I subjected them to War Of The Worlds Multi Channel and it was absolutely stunning, I was completely lost for the duration, hanging on to Richard Burtons every word and emerged into the story completely. The bluetooth range is outrageously good compared to anything else I have, with the phone in the house I can reach the end of my garden (30m+) with ease and that's on 'Sound quality preferred' setting! All in all I'm struggling to find fault with these at all, maybe the price but realistically is there anything better out there?

These headphones are definitely more comfortable to wear for longer periods in part because the of the shape of the earcups, but more so because of the improved feel of the soft leather padding around the earcups. They also appear to provide much better soundproofing from exterior noise as they fit closer to the shape of your face, and that's without switching on Noise Cancelling which is excellent. Putting the headphones onto your head is now so much easier with the sliding headband, no more clicky settings, they just fit first time and I found the band very comfortable, possibly more so than the 1000XM4's. As for the touch controls on the right earcup, I think sensitivity may have been improved as sliding my finger up and down or across the cup face worked first time every time. Taking phone calls also worked very well, could hear my caller no problem and same for the person calling hearing me clearly. The voice pickup to temporarily pause music playing when talking to someone is nice to have as well and didn't let me down, can be activated/de-activated in the Sony app, your choice. As for sound quality, they are superb and is probably somewhat dependant on quality of the music files played. If you can play Flac/Lossless files using LDAC audio then you will love them as Sony have clearly done work on improving all aspects of the sound stage. I have played Classical, Pop, Rock and Electronic music files and in my opinion the instrument separation from bass through middle to treble was much clearer, especially in the top range. Bass wasn't overbearing, but you can make it so from your sound source and it might overtake the mid to high notes, but everyone has their own preference, just saying you can boom the bass if you want it. All in all I think Sony have a winner once again. If I was to find one thing I didn't like so much, it's the case. I know its a different setup to the folding 1000XM4's case which I really like, albeit you can't fold that down flatter like the one provided with the 1000XM5.

Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what’s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony’s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:17599387104131483155_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjapqzdupH-AhVmElkFHZPwAiEQqSQIbA\"}, {\"date\": \"December 11, 2022\", \"title\": \"So far, so good.\", \"rating\": 4, \"source\": \"Jeff Foot · Review provided by sony.co.uk\", \"content\": \"These are an early Christmas present for me, the first over-ear wireless headphones I’ve had, chosen because of the reviews testifying to very good sound quality, good noise cancellation, comfort and battery staying power. I’ve had them a couple of weeks and have used them most days, mainly in the evening but occasionally walking around doing things in the house - not used them outside. Mostly I’ve listened to music but I’ve heard a couple of podcasts too. The sound quality is lovely - the effects of tracks from Jean Michel Jarre where sound switches from one side to the other and back is reproduced brilliantly and the delicate background noises of trees rustling and goats on tracks recorded outside by Ballake Sissoko playing kora are fabulous. The human voice is a rich sound too, again with no apparent loss with even breathing audible on tracks where it was meant to be heard. Battery life seems very good. They arrived with about 60% charge and I recharged them when they got down to about 20% but that took about 10-14 days’ use of maybe 2 hours a day. No idea whether that’s good in comparison to others but certainly good enough for me. The set up was easy, noise cancellation is excellent from what I can make out, but I find the ability to pause this temporarily to head what someone is saying to me particularly helpful - just hold a hand over the right earpiece, ambient sound is restored very quickly and clearly, remove the hand and the music resumes. The headphones are comfy to wear, easy to adjust and while not tight, they seem to stay out so far when I’m bending down. The only very minor negative is that my ears get quite warm after I’ve worn them for about 1-2 hours, so I’m not sure I’d want them on for really extended periods. But that would be the same or worse for all headphones so no difference for these and I suspect other models might not be as comfortable. It’s true there are no free lunches and you get what you pay for, but with these I feel I’ve got good value for money. They come in a protective case which also contains the charging cable, and the app might be useful for connoisseurs wanting to tweak the set up but I’ve just used them with my music app on the phone. So, I’d say so far, so good. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17755277695162489284/reviews?q=sony+wh-1000xm5&prds=eto:17599387104131483155_0,pid:8123523306754565002,rsk:PC_11648784580466805463&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjapqzdupH-AhVmElkFHZPwAiEQqSQIbA\"}], \"product_img\": \"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ682abQrRBfLPKJ7RbUoVodFyGVwLZJLwrtgy8ya3JDp3lTZEqtuqI18PtDEcxMk85QM0nDEyDG8DvOwTiYZddw-KJNRtOd3iFQ4-9mpo\", \"review_count\": 2376, \"product_specs\": [[\"Product Type\", \"Headphones -

Packaging: Everything comes included in a small box, right away you can tell that the packaging was very well thought out and designed. Included in the box: Is a USB-A to USB-C cable, an upgrade to the older micro USB-B cable, so I liked that. Also inside the box you will find three different tips that are placed on the earbuds themselves, they come in small, medium and large, already installed are the medium sized ones, These fit the best for me. Also included are “bands” these bands wrap around the earbuds themselves. Basically what they do is they form a seal around your ear, These serve two purposes 1. they seal out outside noises out, and 2. They make the earbud fit perfect perfectly inside of your ear canal to protect against the ear buds falling out. Pairing: Connecting the earbuds to my smart phone was really easy, just press the button in the back of the charging case for a couple of seconds, pair them with your smart phone, and that’s it. Pretty standard and pretty easy. App: You’ll soon be prompted to download the Bose app. I Recommend everybody do this for couple of reasons, you can play around with the sound EQ settings, you can know exactly how much charge your earbuds have, you can program and swap different shortcuts, and the app can show you very well detailed tips on how to work your new earbuds, meaning it’ll show you how to pause your music, skip to the next song and raise or lower the volume by simply touching the side of the earbuds with your finger. Finally the thing I appreciate most about this app is that it doesn’t require you to create any kind of account if you don’t want to. Sound: The sound is as good as I have ever heard earbuds sound, clean, crisp, excellent highs, excellent mids, and the bass is good enough (these are not super bass heavy) there’s not much else to say really, these just sound great. Noice Cancelling: Perhaps the single greatest feature of these earbuds have is their sound canceling ability. When in “Quiet” mode, The earbuds block out sound better than any earbuds I have ever tried before, then there’s “Aware” turn this on if you still want to listen to your music but still be able to hear outside noises (like if you are out in the street and still want to hear cars coming) I think what happens here is the microphone gets turned on and you’re then able to then hear the outside noises this way, kind of like a hearing aid. Both Quiet mode and Aware mode work very well. Conclusion: I recommend Bose’s newest earphones to anybody that is reading my review and interested in this product, you will be happy with your purchase. I highly recommend downloading the app and downloading the newest software update for them for the best experience. + Sound + Design + Features +App +The Bands +Comfortable +Battery life -Charging case is made of plastic and feels somewhat cheap \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"September 6, 2022\", \"title\": \"Outstanding BOSE sound quailty\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"SteveC · Review provided by bestbuy.com\", \"content\": \"We’ve used a few earbuds in the past, always different brands and were never totally satisfied with the sound quality, “especially me with some hearing issues”. Bose has come out with a new model of the Quietcomfort earbuds, the “II” model was just released, and we decided to give them a try. Unboxing and setup: The earbuds come in a very small Bose logoed box, and inside there’s a charger case, “with the earbuds nestled inside”, a USB C charging cable, sm/lg eartips, sm/lg stability bands “the medium was already on the buds”, a quick start guide and a small but surprisingly thick manual in multiple languages. The first thing I did was to plug in the charging cable “have plenty of USB C ones already so didn’t bother with the OEM one, let them charge up and proceeded to start syncing. We also installed the Bose Music Android App before proceeding. Synching on our Samsung phones was simple, just open the lid to the charger, press the button on the back of the case/charger so the blue light blinks on the front then search/pair on your phone. Once we did that and the Bose app found them it immediately showed there was an update, so we let that proceed “which does take a few minutes so just be patient”. After the earbuds were paired it was time to try them out. Now these buds are a little larger than the Samsung ones we have “not by much” and they do stick down a little more than them too, but once you find your fit they are just as comfortable “maybe a little bit better IMO”, they didn’t feel like they were going to fall out easily and the app has a test you can run to be sure they are seated correctly. I do like to that they don’t actually turn on till one of them “right for us” is inserted and then you’ll hear the voice prompt confirming and battery charge. Use: We were both totally blown away by the sound quality, there’s even plenty of bass for us, and having any bass in a earbud is a pretty tough feat. Naturally it’s not chest pounding bass but it’s more than enough to give the feeling of nice deep bass, and that’s adjustable in the EQ of the App. We also like that you can adjust the noise cancellation can be adjusted from 0 “none” to 100 “max cancellation”, with it turned up to 100 I couldn’t make out what my wife was saying standing right in front of me, the same with her when she was wearing them, which was a little odd but easily adjusted so you can at least make out some background noise. These would be perfect in a very noisy environment as long as you don’t need to hear what’s going on around you. There are also multiple presets “modes” that you can pick from and even customize your own. There’s also a setting in the noise cancellation that uses what BOSE calls “Active Sense”, it’s under the “Aware” mode, and it will adjust the cancellation for loud noises so it will protect your hearing from very loud noises. It actually worked pretty well when I ran the vacuum cleaner, I could tell the sound was muffled but as soon as I turned it off I could hear the background noises again, “pretty neat”. I went outside and did some light yard work and only once did one of the buds come out a little, and that caused the sound to pause, so you know it’s not inserted correctly, an easy slight twist put it right back in. I contributed that to sweat running around my ears as it was 108F out and after a few minutes out in that anyone is going to be sweating. I’ve never had earbuds fit as well as these, most of the time I would just quit using them halfway through a project as they kept popping out due to sweat. As for call quality, neither of us had issues hearing calls, everyone said they heard us clearly and even with my hearing issues I could easily make out what everyone was saying. I will say I wish the equalizer could be adjusted for each earbud individually. My right ear is my troublemaker, and it would be nice to be able to adjust the equalizer separately so I could fine tune them. These actually sound much better than my Siemens hearing aids, and they don’t cost nearly as much. Listening to music is no compairson with them, and I usually use a full headphone to get full sound with the Bose I can get the same effect. The controls are easy to use, the outside of the main piece that sticks out “sort of a oblong pill shape” , is the touch sensitive control. You can swipe up/down for volume, tap twice to advance track, three taps reverses and one tap pauses, pretty simple. You can answer calls with a single tap, and The only issue I had there is the touch area is very sensitive and it’s very easy to bump when you reach up to adjust the buds or try a function. Grabbing them gently by the sides and not bumping the touch sensitive area can be a little difficult at times but I’m sure it just takes some practice, but you have to be careful till you get used to them. Conclusion: We’ve never owned earbuds that actually sound as good as these, and the noise cancellation is simply amazing. I find myself wearing these most of the day as they are comfortable enough to forget you are wearing them, “I just have to remember not to have the noise cancellation up too high or I’ll never hear my wife calling for me, vice versa too”. If you are looking for a premium set of earbuds, and yes they do cost more than others but you are getting BOSE sound quality that goes with that. I won’t be using any of my other buds as they will just not stand up to these in any way that I can see, and for me, the sound quality is just unmatched. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"December 8, 2022\", \"title\": \"Very good, although not quite perfect\", \"rating\": 4, \"source\": \"SPZ02 · Review provided by bose.com\", \"content\": \"Having used a variety of over-ear headphones and earbuds of varying budgets (££ to £££), wired and wireless, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the Bose QC II Earbuds. Took me a while to get them fitting how I liked, especially as the fitment was different to the usual wired earbuds I've used for years, with the ear canal piece being more rectangular than circular. Eventually got them sitting right and the fitment does actually feel better than what I've been used to. Saying that, I often get this little nagging feeling that the left earpiece is going to come loose, and yet it's very much firmly in place if I try to move it about. Tried various combinations of the different sized accessories with no real improvement, but it's a minor quibble, especially as I've used these for home workouts successfully; they've certainly never come close to falling out or anything like that. Noise-cancelling is decent. A lot is made of how class-leading these are in that respect, and I certainly don't think they're anything less than very good in that department, but in terms of blocking out outside noise when there's no audio playing, I don't think they're a clear step-up over what I've been used to. Audio quality is good; definitely an improvement over my various pairs of earbuds I've had, although no better than a pair of popular wireless headphones I have, but then those have much larger drivers, so perhaps an unfair comparison. Only mentioning because I saw someone mention elsewhere that they replaced their OE headphones with a pair of earbuds, and I don't think I'd be doing that myself; these QC IIs are very much for situations where bigger headphones aren't really suitable, such as going outside or exercising/running etc. Bluetooth connection/App seems stable, not had any connectivity issues so far. Actually went into the garage and forgot to take my phone with me, but the signal was still fairly stable, even though I was quite some distance from the source and had several doors/buildings blocking the signal potentially, so I'd have no concerns about dropouts in normal usage, impressive in that regard. Touch controls are simple and effective, although the pause/resume function does \\\"feel\\\" a bit laggy, but that may well be to do with ensuring pausing/resuming gestures aren't mixed up with the next/previous track function. Not a big deal as audio stops promptly if you tap the earbuds, I just have to remind myself to give them a few seconds to resume when I tap them again. I do wish there was a little audio beep or something when adjusting the volume as there is with my headphones. Although speaking of volume, these do need to be at a higher volume level than what I'm used to with other headphones/earbuds that I wear. Overall, a good buy. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"December 21, 2022\", \"title\": \"Excellent Bass, Good Noise Cancelling for Ear Buds\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"GEG87 · Review provided by bose.com\", \"content\": \"I have always wanted to try Bose headphones knowing them to be a premium brand and having read many reviews. I have gone through a number of ear buds from a range of companies some premium and some more mainstream and always found the sound quality lacking in earbuds style as opposed to over ear designs. When I received my earbuds they were well packaged as you would expect the card case separates to reveal the various components of buds, case, cable and varying size buds and surround seals to ensure a good fit within the ear. As always frustratingly having opened the box everything needs charging so no fun for the first night! Within the pack is the QR code to download the Bose software for both IOA and android devices. Once charged and with software installed the setup was incredibly easy, it found the buds without having to go to settings find devices add pairing codes etc they just connected and then the software guided through the fitting phase to ensure the correct buds and surrounds were fitted. The sound test suggested everything was good to go. WOW was my first impression of sound quality, these little buds really had some good bass, within the app there is an equaliser which lets you change the base mid and treble and I am the sort of person that loves more Bass and Treble. these earbuds did not disappoint in sound quality for sure. Next came the programming of tap which in comparison to other models is more limited as there is basically a choice of which ear for the two settings, double taps, long taps etc are not catered for in this part of the app. The next test was for noise counselling which I have only ever found work fully on over the ear designs at premium prices. The noise cancellation in a normal environment is actually really good for these, it does not cancel everything but it certainly makes a difference and more so than other buds I have had in the past from premium brands. The only fault I have found is when cycling or running in wind conditions this is replicated as white noise slightly while listening to music. I think the only thing I have been disappointed with is the inability to charge the case wirelessly unless I have an incompatible charger this is not a feature of these earbuds as there was no evidence of charging no matter how I laid down the case and this is something I assumed would be the case. Overall these are the best earbuds I have owned so far, they compare with other brands but will still not beat over the ear! \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"December 28, 2022\", \"title\": \"Another flagship wireless earbuds from Bose\", \"rating\": 5, \"source\": \"JC · Review provided by johnlewis.com\", \"content\": \"Designing appearances: First of all, the improvement of the charging box is particularly obvious. The charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II returns from the jewelry box style of the previous generation to the design direction of the mainstream TWS earphone charging box, resulting in a smaller size. What's more interesting is that the battery life of the charging box of Bose QC Earbuds II has been upgraded in spite of the reduced size! Wearing experience: The earplugs have undergone substantial alterations. Bose QC Earbuds II divided the previous generation of fish fin earplugs into two sections, the eartips and the stability bands, and called it \\\"Fit Kit ear kit\\\" The meaning of the Fit Kit is to solve the problem of ear fit for different users. You may encounter a certain type of noise-canceling earphones that are recognized as excellent in noise-canceling, but it feels average when it comes to you. The reason for this is probably that the earphones are not well adapted to your ear shape. After all, everyone's ear shape is different, and many people even have differences between their left and right ears. Noise-cancelling capability: Everyone who is familiar with the working principle of noise-cancelling headphones knows that the headphones will analyze and collect sound waves from the external environment, and create a reverse sound wave in the ear to cancel. The current flagship noise-cancelling headphones on the market perform very well in this regard. The Bose QC Earbuds II went a step further on this basis, focusing on the part of the ear, and made a smart in-ear sound field adjustment technology. When you insert the earbuds, you will hear a tone, which means that the smart in-ear sound field adjustment is working. At this time, it will automatically analyze the structure of the wearing ear canal, and then optimize the noise cancellation effect and sound quality of the earphones, thereby realizing \\\"volume customization\\\". Sound quality: The official description, the sound concept of Bose QC Earbuds II is balanced. After actual listening, I personally think it is true. The first impressions are incredibly supple and enduring. Each of the three frequency bands is fairly orderly, and nobody is trying to steal the show. Summarize: If you are looking for noise reduction and wearing comfort, Bose QC Earbuds II will not disappoint you! \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"March 15, 2023\", \"title\": \"A music producers opinion\", \"rating\": 4, \"source\": \"DJN · Review provided by bose.com\", \"content\": \"After ditching my old amazon bought earbuds and wearing over the had headphones for the better part of a year or so, I finally decided to get myself new earbuds. After about a month of research into what's on offer today I decided to use the 90-day risk free trial that is offered directly from Bose and go for the QC2, which are easily one of the most expensive earbuds you can buy, so do you get what you pay for? Yes. But here is my breakdown of all the features, from someone who has been producing and making music in studios for over a decade, I know a little thing or two about sound. So here goes. The Fit: Having the option between 3 different ear tip buds and 3 different wing bands leaves you with a good amount of choice in finding the fit that works for you, initially I found a good fit and the earbuds stay pretty firm in my ears for the most part. They have yet to actually fall out but I do find myself adjusting the left earbud quite frequently, as I get the feeling that it's going to fall out. This is quite annoying but manageable, and will be different for each user. I'm confident you'll find a good enough fit. The earbuds are comfortable for long periods of time and I have worn them for working out and they do stay put, but again, I find myself adjusting them a bit. Overall 4/5. The sound: I was expecting great things from the sound but overall, it is okay. It certainly isn't the best I've experienced, but certainly not the worst. The tuning is very well balanced I think, and there's no unusual emphasis on the Bass which is what a lot of companies tend to do so you get a fairly equal sound. I do sometimes find the high ends to be a bit harsh, particularly when listening to distorted guitar solos (Metallica, Megadeth etc) but this isn't too often. I do wish the sound would go louder though, My old earbuds would go very loud before hitting that phone sound warning that said you are in hearing loss territories but the QC2 don't go very loud before hitting that threshold, I find myself on the highest setting before the mark which is annoying because sometimes you want that loudness. This is probably my biggest gripe in terms of the sound, as a musician I appreciate the overall balance that these earbuds provide, but again, for the absolute best sound experience there are probably better earbuds out there. Overall 4/5 The noise cancelling and aware mode: Easily the best noise cancelling I've personally ever experienced. The quiet mode setting, truly gets rid of the outside world, it is remarkable. I can walk down the street with the setting enabled, with cars roaring passed me and I barely notice they are there, I'm focused on the sound on my ears which is an absolute blessing. The aware mode, which simulates Apples transparency mode is okay, I find there to be quite a bit of unnatural white noise which can become a bit tiresome after a while but overall it does a decent job. It also has an automatic feature which dampens loud sound around you (for example a door slamming) which is quite cool, but feels a bit weird. The noise cancelling though? Excellent. Overall 5/5 The app: I'm really not the biggest fan of the app. It's plain, boring, uninspired and you really don't get a lot from it. There's some tips and 'tricks' on there that really just tell you how to get the best fit for your ears etc. It let's you set two more custom noise settings (letting you adjust the level of noise cancelling and aware mode levels.) There's an EQ which lets you adjust the Bass, Mids, and Highs on the earbuds but you only get 3 bands which compared to other sound apps (JBL for instance) is quite terrible. If you want to adjust the sound I would recommend using a separate app with more customising options. Most of the time I find the earbuds cannot connect to the app anyway and without the connection, you are unable to do anything on the app, rendering it completely useless. Overall once you've had a look at the app, set your EQ preferences and set your noise modes, you won't be using it much and it's quite forgettable. Overall I'd give these earbuds a 4/5. With a good fit, good sound, great noise cancelling and and okay app these earbuds are certainly up there in terms of what you can buy. I do however think they are overpriced. I personally just do not think they are that good to be charging one of the highest prices on the market for earbuds, if you can get these discounted then certainly go for it but at full price, I do think there are probably pretty good cheaper alternatives. If you're main buying point is noise cancelling though, you probably want to take the plunge on these though. Do I regret buying them? No, they are good. But think carefully about how much you are willing to spend. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"December 9, 2022\", \"title\": \"Best noise cancelling\", \"rating\": 4, \"source\": \"techsavy · Review provided by bestbuy.com\", \"content\": \"These are the best noise cancelling earbuds, I have owned Jabra, Samsung, and Sony earbuds also. These have such good noise cancelling that my wife came behind me while I was doing dishes talking to my and said I could hear her and was just pretending I couldn't hear her, but I really couldn't hear her..... Now for the negative, my wife owns a dog training business and there are a lot of dogs that bark, it does a good job blocking out the barking except the very high pitches which you hear a popping sound, which I heard from interference with certain manufacturer machines that have a high pitch sound also. I do dislike how the left earbud is slave to the right earbud, which means you can't use the earbuds independently, with the right earbud being the master bud. But hopefully they will fix this with a futures update. But what I do LOVE and these earbuds is that I can pause, play, volume up/down, move track forward/backwards, and move between the different ANC seeing simultaneously with the right earbud. This is a phenomenal feature that I believe these are the only earbuds that have. They have definitely improved the Bass in this version and have superior sounds (Sony XM4's still have the best drivers but not much of a difference between these and Don't). Case size is normal for this price range, the obly 2 downsizes is no wireless charging (which I normally never use) and that the earbuds are not magnetic, sometimes they don't get a good connection to charge, but doesn't happen too often). People do complain about the eartip design, which does take a little to get use to, but after having it for a couple weeks, it does help with the ANC. As far as it's shape, I LOVE it. The XM4's, Samsung, and Jabras I would accidently be pressing the buttons taking the earbuds in and out, with these I can mess with them without worrying, which is a stress relieve. Battery life, they are not as good as Jabras, which have the best battery life I have tried yet, but after Jabra, they are are average for the price range. They ANC does drain the battery but as much as other brands, but worth it for how good the ANC is. Price range, the price is about right for what you are getting. Final words, they are the best wireless earbuds I have owned out of multiple brands for what I need. If you want best sound quality, go with the Sony XM4'S the 2022 version, not the /B version (which is having battery drain issues right now due to firmware update). If you want top of the line earbuds in budget I would go with either Jabra or Samsung, which both are GREAT earbuds. But the BOSE have THE BEST ANC, have all controls on the right earbud, great sound quality, and come from a good company. Do they have everything I want? NO, but I won't find an earbud that does. Do I sometimes question these earbuds, yes. Would I buy these again, in a heartbeat. So if you want an overall top of the line for earbuds, these are great! The only reason that I don't give them 5 stars is due to the periodically popping sound, which other earbuds have also (Sony, Dr. Dre) but should be able to be fixed in a software update, which when that happens I will give 5 stars and I am a rough at rating, my wife can tell you that. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"January 7, 2023\", \"title\": \"Don't buy Bose at any cost!\", \"rating\": 1, \"source\": \"Kitty · Review provided by johnlewis.com\", \"content\": \"I originally bought the Quiet Comfort earbuds in January 2022 which needed replacing and repair about 4 times in a few months (which obviously took up A LOT of time with the admin of talking to JL and going into store etc), until the last time they got sent away where I was told there'd be a week turn around to receive another new pair. Fast forward 6 weeks and they're still 'in progress'. Had to speak to JL (and Bose) directly to find out they had no stock to send my replacement. I was about to give up and get a refund when I suggested I'd try the upgraded pair if JL would offer me that free of charge, which they kindly did (£30 difference). I received the QC II and had similar problems, left bud always draining of charge or not fully charging, the sound warping between both earbuds, the microphone picking up too much background noise so phone calls outside meant the recipient was not able to hear me, as well as trouble connecting to my phone on every start up, taking about 5-10 mins, putting them back in their case, restarting Bluetooth, opening and closing the app etc. Very inconvenient on the go. Alongside all these defects, the design was off for me. In order to scroll through various noise cancelling levels you can't just hold your finger on the earbud (which also, by the way, didn't fit in my ear properly so fell out multiple times, so-much-so I avoided wearing them when moving a lot), you have to press for ~2 seconds then release for ~2 seconds then press again etc to go through your various modes, which I felt was generally impractical and annoying, especially as it didn't respond to heavy touch but equally didn't with too light a touch. It also meant the right one was even more likely to fall out of my ear. It also made me look like a wannabe Spy. The noise cancelling also broke on the first few pairs I had, and a high pitched whining noise existed when not listening to music. To operate the volume control it requires a swipe, but it never seem to respond properly and would often pause my music or end the call I was on (which is actually the double tap function). All in all, it was a terrible purchase I wish I'd never made, but it was made slightly simpler by the fact the in-store John Lewis Tech team in Bristol made the return easy for me and were very helpful. I am now sworn off Bose for good (I also have a portable speaker which has connective and sound quality issues) but the silver lining is that I would purchase from JL again, knowing that my purchase was protected. \", \"review_link\": \"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3044623037472677842/reviews?q=bose+quietcomfort&prds=eto:4652385147255006492_0,pid:1638080895752058856,rsk:PC_5233022566923072&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio5pndupH-AhUMEFkFHRNoBTQQqSQIeg\"}, {\"date\": \"October 5, 2022\", \"title\": \"amazing sound quality. lacks some features\", \"rating\": 4, \"source\": \"jessi · Review provided by walmart.com\", \"content\": \"I rate these headphones a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the sound quality but I have a few things I'm disappointed in especially because of the price point. i really wish the bose name wasn't so large on the side of the earbud it's so distracting wish it was maybe smaller or on an edge. it has no wireless charging BUT that means it weighs less not an issue for me. there is no indication on the case that says anything about the battery and its a bigger case than other types of wireless earbuds but significantly smaller than past bose cases so that's good. there isnt a button that allows you to open the case which means that the case opens too easily also from my experience. the magnets don't really help the case stay closed. the process to pair it is a little difficult. first of all you have to have the app which i don't like and a lot of other wireless headphone don't need an app but if you want to customized your sound quality these are a great option.i like the ear buds that just pair with the phone by Bluetooth but this is definitely very technical The best part about these headphones is that they do live up to the Bose name in terms of noise canceling. It feels like it adjusts to the sound intensity. The quality of calling people is good also because it's very clear. I do agree that the charging time for the earbuds lasts about 6 hours with no issues. Again, you can customize the sound quality on the app. As most earbuds, these come with 3 different soft silicone ear tips and 3 stability bands but for the price I do think there need to be even more tip options for a good fit for everyone These look big in my ears but I was suprised they aren't heavy. I do wish that again for the price point that they would come with the option of over the ear holders too. It seems big but they do have a lot of features especially the swiping on the outside of the earbud wide portion that's unique and there's enough room for your finger to slide easily and a groove to know when to stop You do need to use certain functions on certain earbud and not that can be done on either one. The quiet and aware modes are unique and I'm glad there two options, you may need to play around to get used to them. I personally like the aware mode as it allows for more background noise to get in and I can still pay attention to other things, but there is an area you can change the noise cancelation and tailor it. I think you can only use the voice feature on the right earbud. you can't use one earbud independent of another at the moment uless you leave both outside the case but i did read it may become Available in an update. you also have to be careful with the amplifying power of these earbuds because some sounds are so loud in your ear. personally i do not walk around with earbuds i only use them to work out but would definitely not wear these all the time if I was looking for that option without removingsome of the noise canceling because its so intense almost like wearing earplugs. PLEASE add a find my earbud feature to the app it's really needed!

You know it's working as each bud plays a short note before announcing the device it's paired with, and that announcement goes from being a tad muffled to crystal-clear in the space of a second or less, as the NC is adjusted. Sound Quality The Bose buds have a beefy sound that's underpinned with solid bass, not muddy in any way. The top end can be shrill but is easily moderated with the in-app equalizer. The noise cancellation really helps by removing all distractions and allowing you to focus on the music, it might not be audiophile quality but it is very satisfying. Noise Cancelling Just amazing. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 which were, until now, pretty much unbeatable. The Boses handily trump them. There is some hiss if you have them NC on with no music, in a quiet room, but in any other scenario they are a miracle made flesh, they simply erase what's going on around you better than any other headphone I've heard. The 'aware' mode is great too, people talk about the Apple Airpods Pro as having the best but these are in the same division, passed through noise sounds very natural and that mode doesn't make the music sound tinnier as some others I've heard do. Battery life Good, or rather, normal. 6 hours-ish plus 2 more charges from the case with NC on all the time. Fit and comfort Good, if unusual. There is a pack containing 3 sets of rings and 3 sets of ear tips, the rings help to hold the buds in place and form a seal, the tips do what tips normally do and you can get a perfect fit by mixing and matching them. The app has a sound test you can run to check if you have the best fit, which works perfectly. In my case the defaults were just fine. Once setup, they don't wobble or feel in any way loose Conclusion Amazing. \", \"review_link\":
