        "text": "A great pair of headphones shouldn't only sound rich and balanced but should also be comfortable, versatile, well-built, and feature-packed. While you can get some surprisingly decent budget models, the best headphones tend to come with more extra features, like active noise cancelling (ANC), dedicated companion apps for customization, multi-device pairing, and NFC compatibility. While less expensive pairs of headphones tend to miss out on some of these premium features, you can still find some well-rounded and versatile options that provide great value. We've tested over 710 pairs of headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best you can buy. See our picks for the best Bluetooth earbuds, the best wireless headphones, and the best noise cancelling headphones. The Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless are the best headphones we've tested. These versatile premium over-ears have an ANC system that does an outstanding job of blocking ambient sound, including rumbling engines and background conversations, so they're a great choice for commuting or traveling. Their battery lasts for roughly 37 hours with the ANC on, so you don't need to worry about running out of power during long days on the go. While Sony recently released a newer edition of these headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless, they aren't as comfortable for most people, and their ANC has a hard time blocking out noise in the bass range. These comfortable headphones have a bass-heavy default sound profile that emphasizes the thump and rumble in genres like EDM and hip-hop. If you prefer a different sound, it can also be customized with a graphic EQ and presets in their companion app. Unfortunately, even with the EQ, you may find their sound somewhat muddy and cluttered. If that's a deal-breaker for you, you may want to consider the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless instead, which have a more neutral default sound profile with less overall bass. However, their ANC doesn't block out as much noise, and they have shorter continuous battery life. From this price point onwards, Anker dominates the market. Their Q lineup targets each price range, and most options in the lineup are well-equipped with features like ANC, multi-device pairing, and companion app support, which make them hard to ignore. That said, their top-of-the-line model is the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless, which are significantly cheaper than the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless, but come with a step down in build quality and comfort, as well as shorter continuous battery life. Still, they offer a few of the same features and have a comparable noise cancelling performance. Their ANC does a fantastic job of blocking out a wide range of ambient sound, although it's not quite as effective with bass-range sounds like rumbling engines as the Sony. You can set the ANC to different levels manually or use the 'Adaptive ANC' feature to adjust automatically to your surroundings. Their v-shaped default sound profile is well-suited for genres like pop and rock and can also be customized with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app. They also support LDAC, Sony's proprietary codec for hi-res audio. They last for around 27 hours of continuous use and have physical controls in the form of buttons on the ear cups, which you might prefer if you want to adjust the volume while wearing gloves. Unlike the Sony headphones, they don't have virtual surround sound or customization options like button mapping, but they support multi-device pairing and NFC for quicker pairing. The Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones Wireless are a solid middle-of-the-road pick since they offer many of the same features as the higher-end Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless but at a lower price point. Although their ANC doesn't block out as much ambient sound, particularly when it comes to the rumbles of bus and plane engines, they're better suited for cutting down office chatter. They also have a comfortable, well-built fit for long listening sessions. You can even stay connected to your PC and smartphone simultaneously, thanks to their multi-device pairing support. Out of the box, they have a v-shaped sound profile that delivers extra warmth and boom, while sibilants like cymbals are bright. Their companion app also offers a graphic EQ and presets so that you can finetune their sound to your liking. They last over 22 hours continuously too. If you're looking for over-ears with a longer battery life, you'll want to consider the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 Wireless instead. They deliver over 44 hours continuously, so you can go for a few days without having to recharge them. However, they leak audio at high volumes, so if you want to crank up your favorite tunes, others around you can hear parts of it. If you're looking for a cheaper pair of headphones, look at another offering from Anker, the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless. They're an earlier version of the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless and aren't as well-built. However, they offer a better overall ANC performance than their successor and do a better job blocking out bass-range sounds like engine noise during your commute. They support multi-device pairing and have a similarly comfortable fit for most people. Their battery lasts for about 44 hours continuously with ANC on, and they're equipped with an auto-off timer to help save power. They have an excited sound profile that gives the audio extra bass and sparkly vocals, which makes them well-suited for genres like rock and pop. Their app also includes a graphic EQ and presets that you can use to adjust their sound to your taste. Unfortunately, their sound seems more hollow and thin when the ANC is turned off. They have a worse overall mic performance, so you may want to keep that in mind if you want headphones for phone calls and online meetings. If you're on a tight budget, check out the Logitech G435 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. While they're no-frills gaming headphones and have a smaller overall fit since they're aimed at teens and tweens, they're still worth considering if you're looking for wireless headphones. Their warm sound profile is well-suited for gaming and music, as they can help emphasize sound effects while keeping vocals and instruments bright in mixes. Unlike other casual use picks on this list, they also have a more open and spacious soundstage to help immerse you in your audio. These over-ears have a comfortable and lightweight fit, though their build quality is quite plasticky and doesn't feel the most sturdy. That said, they don't have ANC and don't block out much background noise, which can be frustrating in noisy commutes or office settings. Their battery doesn't last as long as the Anker Life Q30 Wireless continuously either, although their under 20 hours of playtime time will still be enough for most use cases. However, if you're looking for longer-lasting over-ears and don't mind paying a little more, it's worth checking out the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Wireless. Like other models in the Q lineup, they last over 30 hours with their ANC on. However, this model lacks an auto-off timer to help conserve battery life when not in use. The Sennheiser HD 800 S are the best audiophile headphones we've tested if you're looking for an immersive audio experience. If you have the budget, these premium over-ears offer some of the best sound money can buy. However, you'll need to purchase a high-grade amp if you want to properly drive them, which can be an additional investment if you don't already have one. They have an open-back design, which allows audio to escape the ear cups and bounce off the walls around you, creating a spacious and open passive soundstage. On the flip side, they're designed for use in an enclosed room as they won't block out any background noise and leak audio across the range. While this isn't a problem if you're listening to tracks in a quiet space like a studio, audio bleed can ruin a recording, while ambient sound can make it harder to monitor a live session properly. They also have a well-balanced and neutral sound suitable for most audio content. Although they have trouble reproducing a thumpy low-bass, they have a touch of extra high-bass to add warmth to audio. Their mid-range is flat, so vocals and lead instruments are clearly and accurately reproduced. They also have excellent build quality, and their fit is comfortable enough for long listening sessions. Unlike casual-use headphones, the price range for mid-level audiophile headphones is quite large, and there are many options available at different costs. That said, the HiFiMan Edition XS stand out from the pack, and even though they're more upper mid-range in price, they offer a performance that rivals other high-end models. These open-backs have planar-magnetic drivers instead of more common dynamic drivers like the Sennheiser HD 800 S. Although they have a larger, bulkier frame due to their driver design, it helps them reproduce bass more accurately and create an immersive audio experience. As a result, they have a very neutral sound profile with clear and present vocals and lead instruments. Their passive soundstage also seems fairly natural, wide, and spacious. However, they aren't as well-built as our top pick, and their headband feels heavier than other headphones in this manufacturer's lineup. It may be problematic if you want to wear them for long periods, so you may want to check out the HiFiMan Sundara 2020 instead. They're not only more affordable, but their ski-band headband can distribute the weight more evenly across your head, resulting in a more comfortable overall fit. That said, they produce sound audio less consistently and create a less out-of-head passive soundstage. If you're on a tight budget or are looking for an inexpensive first pair of audiophile headphones, the Philips SHP9500 are the best entry-level option we've tested. Their fairly neutral sound is suitable for a wide range of genres. They lack more low-bass than the HiFiMan Edition XS, but there's a bump in the high-bass range that adds warmth to help make up for the missing thump and rumble. The mid-range response is very accurate, so vocals and lead instruments are clear and detailed, and the treble is somewhat overemphasized, which adds brightness. Like the other audiophile headphones on this list, they have an open-back design that helps them create a wide, spacious soundstage, although it can seem less natural than the HiFiMan Edition XS'. Their cheaper price doesn't mean sacrificing comfort, meaning most people can wear them for long listening sessions without fatigue. However, they aren't as well-built as the previous pick. The materials feel plasticky, and the padding seems prone to tearing. On the plus side, these wired headphones have a detachable cable, so it's easy to replace if it gets damaged. The best earbuds we've tested are the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless. Earbuds have the benefit of portability and can be a great choice for a variety of uses, from work to workouts. These are an updated version of the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Truly Wireless and have an improved ANC performance. They can isolate you very effectively from a broad range of ambient sound, including rumbling engines and background conversations. Their sound profile also has more bass than our rig measured, but this is due to the shape of our rig's ear canals affecting the buds' bass delivery. Subjectively, their bass-rich sound profile brings out the thump and rumble in genres like EDM. While this muddies vocals and instruments, if you prefer a different sound, it can also be adjusted with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app. They support the aptX Adaptive codec, which helps lower latency and improve audio quality via Bluetooth. Their roughly eight-hour continuous battery life can last through a day of work, and they have a comfortable fit for most people. There's a selection of differently-sized ear tips and stability fins included. Once you get a good fit, they're stable enough to stay in place if you use them at the gym or on a run. However, they aren't as well-built as the first Bose QuietComfort earbuds or other premium buds like the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless. Those earbuds have a weaker ANC performance, but you might like their smaller design and features for iOS users, like virtual surround sound and easy pairing. Looking for more earbuds?

Mar 08, 2023:\n                We've replaced the Anker Soundcore Q35 Wireless with the Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones Wireless and the Anker Soundcore Q20 Wireless with the Logitech G435 LIGHTSPEED Wireless. We've also added the Audio-Technica ATH-M20x to Notable Mentions. Feb 10, 2023:\n                Checked that picks represent the best recommendations and that the products are in stock. Jan 06, 2023:\n                Replaced the AKG with the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless because the AKG aren't easy to find in stock. Replaced the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 with the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Truly Wireless, in part because they have a better ANC performance. Aug 22, 2022:\n                We've added the AKG N700NC M2 and the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 to highlight the wide range of headphones available at different price points. We've also replaced the Apple AirPods Pro with the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3, as the Sennheiser offer better noise isolation and more customization, and added some picks to Notable Mentions that didn't quite make the cut. Jul 06, 2022:\n                Checked that picks represent the best recommendations and that the products are in stock. Our recommendations above are what we think are currently the best earbuds and headphones for most people to buy. We factor in the price (cheaper headphones win over pricier ones if the difference isn't worth it), feedback from our visitors, and availability (no headphones that are difficult to find or almost out of stock everywhere). If you would like to choose for yourself, here is the list of all our headphone reviews. Be careful not to get caught up in the details. There are no ideal headphones. Personal tastes, preferences, and listening habits will matter more in your selection.",

Just beautiful, very well built, and slightly fun headphones, while being resolving enough (for my ears), and not crazy demanding. **I would completely agree that they're probably not a great value for most people, and I wouldn't recommend them in most circumstances,** but personally, I'm a huge fan of the trio."

        "text": "right so i've recently decided that i need to get better at focusing and so obviously a pair of noise cancelling headphones is the way to guarantee this and so in this video we're going to be testing these top six noise cancelling headphones to figure out which of these is the best on the market and which of these i am going to buy for myself now the cool thing is we actually have a whole range of these in different price points we have the ridiculously cheap anchor sound cores we have the microsoft surface headphone 2. we have the sony wh xm 1000 m4 or something like that we have the bose qc700s we have the apple airport max and we have the stupidly expensive b and o b o plate h95 and so for each of these what we did is that i tested them extensively myself and we got a few team members to test them all as well and we're going to rate them all in terms of aesthetics in terms of fit and comfort in terms of noise cancellation and in terms of sound quality for music now as you know i'm a fan of upfront conclusions so i'm just going to come out and say that the ones i'll be getting are the sony wh mx4s whatever they're called if you're on a budget the anker sound cores are actually surprisingly reasonable and if you don't care about long-term comfort and are happy to spend a bit more money the apple airpods maxes are the choice for you so if that's all you wanted from the video then thank you very much for watching and do please have a great rest of day but now we're going to go over these one at a time and i'm going to share the pros and the cons of each of these six pairs of headphones and i'll show the results of my personal and our team testing about the various factors so that whichever one of these you're buying you can make hopefully a slightly more informed decision about the noise canceling headphones that are obviously going to change your life so we're going to start with the cheapest ones and these are the anker soundcore q30s which retail for about 100 and if you're on a budget these are actually a really good option and probably the best value for money that you can get in terms of the noise cancellation headphone wireless headphone market their design is a little bit plasticky and flimsy and they come with this sound core case thing which again is nothing to write home about it's got these little cheapy cheap looking pieces of foam in it as well but to be honest for the price it's not bad at all in terms of fit and comfort it's actually pretty reasonable in terms of looks these did get the lowest rating from our team members and from me with most of us rating it either a one or two for an average rating of 1.5 stars in terms of looks but in terms of fit and comfort they're actually pretty reasonable and most of us rated them a four or three so this got a rating of 3.5 in terms of fit and comfort now when it comes to noise cancellation i'm gonna be honest like i tested these fairly extensively and i didn't really notice much of a difference between the noise cancelling capabilities of the different headphones in fairness we are in this fairly quiet environment if i was in an airplane or on a train or in the london underground maybe the noise cancelling test would have been better but as far as i could really tell they were all fairly similar in terms of noise cancelling ability but in terms of sound quality there were some noticeable differences between the six headphones in the lineup the sound is pretty good but i'm not like wowed by it i'm still getting that kind of like cheap feel and these ones clocked in fairly reasonably with an average rating of 3.75 stars across our team the battery life on these is absolutely incredible it's 40 hours apparently with noise cancelling and 60 hours if you turn off the noise cancelling and they've got a few buttons on the bottom where you can increase the volume or decrease the volume or hit play and pause again these are nothing to write home about but if for example you're a student and you're on a budget and you do want a pair of noise cancelling headphones to make it easier to focus when you're working or if you're in a coffee shop or whatever then these are by far the best value for money and they also fall down nicely and can go kind of go into this case and you can shove this little piece of plastic in there somewhere if you really want to but yeah fairly reasonable option if you are on a budget moving up a little bit in terms of price point we now have the microsoft surface headphones too which retail for around about 270 dollars now in terms of aesthetics i actually quite like these especially because they're this sort of silvery whitey kind of color and i'm a fan of things that look white broadly and they have these interesting features in that on both knobs you can like turn the knobs so one of the knobs is full volume and the other knob is for the noise cancellation ability of the headphones allegedly they have multi-device support and so they can connect to two devices at once and allegedly it can switch between your iphone and your macbook if it recognizes you're getting a phone call in practice this feature does not work like it has never once actually worked as intended for me and in terms of battery life it's fairly low it's got around about 18 hours of battery life which means you do have to charge it somewhat regularly if you're going to be using it extensively for long work sessions in terms of aesthetics i gave this a five star rating but some of the team gave it a three and four star so the average rating of this was four stars and in terms of fit and comfort it's actually very reasonable i've got fives and fours across the board with an average rating of 4.3 stars but sadly in terms of sound quality these are just not as good as some of the alternatives so i gave this personally a three out of five in terms of sound quality which was kind of what the team thought as well so this had an average rating of 3.3 stars in terms of music quality so i actually used to use these for about six months in 2021 and i really liked them mostly because of the aesthetic they were quite nice to be honest i hadn't a b tested them with a bunch of different headphones to be honest all these review videos are somewhat artificial because once you have one of these headphones it doesn't really matter which one you have you kind of then just get used to it and that becomes the new normal it's only when you really compare them side by side with like kind of six other headphones that you start to quibble about things like noise quality but broadly i was a big fan of them um when i had them and i like the fact that they came with this nice little case which meant i could just chuck it in my bag and the case had a nice little slot for the cables as well then sadly my tesla got broken into and these got stolen so this is just a pair that we ordered for review purposes but after testing them side by side with all the others i've decided that i'm no longer going to be using the microsoft surface headphones too because the sonys are just a little bit better than them across all fronts except the aesthetics anyway that brings us on to the sony what are they called the sony wh-1000xm4s this is the only real problem with these is that it's impossible to remember what the name is sony really needs to come up with a better way of naming these headphones but they are the ones that i'm going to be now switching to because i think they're the perfect mix of comfort and sound quality and noise cancellation and battery life even if the aesthetic is just slightly less nice than the microsoft surface headphones too now in terms of fit and comfort these actually were the best headphones that we tested they were the most comfortable buy a reasonable margin decent very comfortable most comfortable yet and i think the main reason for that is that these are just so light they are i think probably the lightest out of the six headphones that we've tested although i haven't measured it just on my head they feel really light and when it comes to wearing these for extended periods of time really the comfort correlates strongly with how heavy the headphones are or rather how light the headphones are because the main problem with the airpods max for example like they're amazing in sound quality they're amazing in battery life they're amazing across all fronts it's just that they're really heavy and after like an hour of using them my head starts to hurt from having such heavy headphones on it and so the fact that the sony's are so comfortable to wear for very extended periods of time i think it's mostly down to just how light they are in terms of looks yeah they're not bad the team thought they were five stars and four stars in terms of looks i'd personally rate them a three star because i do prefer the look of the microsoft surface headphones but i mean they're very reasonable they look like just a normal pair of noise cancelling headphones nothing to write home about and in terms of design they fold up nicely like this so it's very easy to pack into a bag and they also come with this little carry case that if you want you can put them in i'm probably not going to do that because that's too much faff i'm just probably going to stick them in my bag exactly like that they charge like all these do by usbc that's pretty standard and unsurprisingly they've got a power button and a button that lets you control the level of noise cancellation in terms of battery life these are actually really good they're advertised as having 30 hours of battery life with the noise cancellation and 38 hours without noise cancellation if you're not into noise cancellation for whatever reason and in terms of sound quality for listening to music i personally thought these were really good i gave them a four star rating sadly this was not mirrored by our team who thought they were more like two stars and three stars in terms of noise quality and so the overall rating for this in terms of sound quality is 3.5 stars but personally i think that's a little bit of an under estimate of what's the actual i say actual my my personal subjective interpretation of their their music quality was and to be honest this sort of subjectiveness you get a lot when it comes to testing headphones like i'm not an audiophile no one in our team is really an audiophile and so we don't objectively know what these headphones sound like all we can say is what our subjective experience like oh this sounds a bit better than that and after doing a bunch of hot swapping to be like are these really sounding better than the surface are these really sounding better than the boses i kind of decided at the end that like yeah whenever i put these on my head i felt ah these are so comfortable and i also felt that oh the sound quality on these is pretty good yeah not as good as the airpods max airplanes backs max wins across the board just blew everyone else out of the water in terms of sound quality but i don't think that trade-off is warranted given how heavy they are and therefore how uncomfortable they are for long periods of time at least for me and so the sony's are the ones that i'm going to be holding on to i haven't figured out whether i want them in white or silver or in blue i'm not too much of a fan of this matte black color but hey they're really good and these are now going to be a staple part of my everyday carry all right now we're spending a little bit more money and we come to the bose qc 700s which retail for 350 but these are a little bit more expensive than the sony's and actually i think the main selling point is the look it does look quite nice um our team was a bit uh split on whether we liked this particular style with these like yeah it's just a slightly different design to most noise cancelling headphones i personally quite like them but in terms of comfort they're not quite as good as the sony's and in terms of sound quality for me also they're not quite as good as the sony's our team rated these pretty poorly across the board so this got an average of 3.25 stars when it came to fit and comfort it got a three stars in terms of noise cancellation and it got a 3.1 stars in terms of sound quality and a 3.2 stars in terms of look so like broadly if we averaged the four four five four four team members that we had testing these broadly we weren't a fan these are actually the ones i've been using for the last six months since my tesla got broken into and i lost my microsoft surface headphones too i've actually been using these but i'm going to give them away to a friend and instead replace them with the sony's because the sony's are marginally better in terms of comfort and in terms of sound quality next we come to the apple airpod maxes which are really expensive and retail for around about 640 dollars at least if you convert the pounds we'll put the actual dollar price over here now these come with the case but we have two team members gordon angus in our studio who use these and they never carry the case with them similarly when i used to use the apple airpods max i never carry the case because the case is totally pointless and genuinely these are really good the sound quality is just way better than all of the other headphones that we tested and when you put these on you immediately think oh my god this sounds incredible compared to the other noise cancelling headphones and anyway it kind of screws up your mind a bit or your ear rather because it makes you think that the others sound bad in comparison to this but then after a while of getting used to the others you stop you you kind of forget what it was like to wear the apple airpods max this is probably the best sounding of them all the sound is amazing the design is a bit polarizing i quite like the blue color personally rather than the black and they've got this little mesh thing at the top which is kind of comfortable but the main thing the main drawback of these as i've said is that they're just too heavy they're very comfortable for short amounts of time but for more than about half an hour i started to find my kind of ears getting a bit tired my head getting a bit tired maybe i'm not hench enough to handle these but i just i just really wasn't a fan in terms of long-term comfort levels now if you have apple devices these are actually really good because there is a chip or something inside them that makes them pair with iphones and macs really easily so you can literally just wear them and they will automatically pair to your iphone or to your mac and really that means that there isn't actually a way of turning them off the way they go into standby mode is when you put them in the case but given that realistically no one really carries the case around because it's kind of useless it does have that slight quirk to them it's got a little button at the top which acts as a little sort of volume dial and also if you press the button down you can access siri but the issue is that these are the only phones that don't have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so if you listen to stuff on airplanes a lot and you want to plug your headphones into the aeroplane system thingy so that you can watch a movie on the aeroplane using your fancy noise canceling headphones you can do that with all the others but you can't do it with the apple airpods max this is not a huge problem like to be honest these were the clear winners in most of the categories in terms of comfort so yeah great pair of headphones super expensive but you do get fantastic sound quality for that but they are not for me because i just can't handle them in terms of the heaviness and the discomfort and finally we come to the big daddies the b o b o play h95s which are ridiculously expensive these come in at 940 or thereabouts and they have they have these like leather thingies around them i think you can actually take these off yeah you can take them off they have leather around them they have this leather thing at the top so it's like a more premium higher end feel to these noise canceling headphones but sadly they are just not very good in terms of the aesthetics our team was a bit split on them i quite like these metal bits and i would have even liked the nordic ice color because these come in a multitude of colors and that color looks really cool but again they run into into the same issue that the airpods max do in that they are quite heavy and so wearing them for extended periods of time can actually get a little bit uncomfortable sound quality as well again it's reasonable most of our team rated them somewhere between three and four stars i would just thought that the sound would be better for this price so the sound quality doesn't feel amazing i thought these were a three star personally i did personally prefer the sound quality of the sony's despite the fact that these are like triple the price but i guess what you're really paying for here is the sort of more premium leather feel of the noise cancelling headphones and to be honest i liked the nordic ice color at least on the website so much that if these were slightly lighter i probably would have gone for these just to have the flecks of like having a really nicely aesthetic pair of headphones sadly they're not comfortable enough to even warrant that so basically i'm not a fan of these despite them being quite expensive and quite high-end oh the other cool thing about them is that they do come in this fancy like metal case thing which feels feels very high-end feels very premium makes you think feel healed oh sick but it's also a case that's quite heavy by itself and so it's not a case that you're really going to be carrying in a backpack it's more for the kind of aesthetics of the unboxing experience and so that you can feel oh i'm a legend because i wear bang olufsen noise canceling headphones now in terms of practical uses of these noise canceling headphones there's three main domains that have made up the bulk of my use of these over the last few years firstly it's listening to my study with me playlist on spotify while i'm trying to work or focus or do any kind of deep work at all second it's consuming things like music and podcast and audiobooks while i'm on things like trains and airplanes because the noise canceling is really helpful and thirdly i find these noise canceling headphones really helpful if i'm editing videos because then with the noise cancelling i can edit videos wherever i go and speaking of editing videos another tool that i find incredibly helpful is called storyblocks who are very kindly sponsoring this video i've been using storyblocks since i started this youtube channel five years ago in 2017. droidblocks is absolutely fantastic it is a subscription service that gives you royalty-free stock photos and stock videos and stock music that you can use in youtube videos just like this one in fact when we got team members to test out the headphones some of the tracks we were using were from storyblocks royalty free so that we can include them in this video without getting copyright stricken for them me and our editors personally find storyblocks super helpful when we're trying to find b-roll and especially in the early days of this youtube channel when i was trying to juggle making videos with the demands of being a medical student and later the demands of being a doctor it was super helpful to have this library of high quality stock footage available to use as b-roll so that i didn't necessarily have to go out and spend hours and hours shooting my own b-roll for all the videos that i was making and other than just videos and music storyblocks also has things like after effect templates and premiere pro templates for titles lower thirds transitions and even sound effects that you can incorporate into your videos whenever you want storyblocks has subscriptions for any budget and so if you want to check it out then do hit the link in the video description so thank you so much storyblocks for sponsoring this video and for helping out the channel over the last five years so overall when it comes to these headphones the budget pick is the anker sound cores which are very reasonable my personal pick is the sony wh mx1000 xm4s or whatever they're called and if you don't care about the comfort thing the airpods maxes are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality if you like this video you might be interested in what sort of podcasts i listen to with my fancy pair of noise cancelling headphones and that'll be in a video over there called 20 podcasts that made me millionaire so thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye "
