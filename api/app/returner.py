        "* $100-200: Sennheiser HD 560S or HD 25* $200-500: E-MU Teak (honestly I'd pick the Moondrop Blessing 2 over any headphone in this price bracket)* $500-1000: Hifiman Ananda or Focal Clear OG* $1000-2000: Hifiman Arya Stealth or HE 1000 V2* $2000+: Hifiman Susvara",
        "$100-200: HD6XX    $200-500: This tier is hard...DT1990, HarmonicDyne Zeus, or Sundara.  Maybe the Hifiman XS?    $500-1000: Focal Clear OG    $1000-2000: Another hard tier. HD800S or LCD-X 2021.  Never tried Arya, but I bet that's in here too.    $2000+: Never heard anything in this tier, but I imagine the usual LCD-5, Susvara, and Utopia win this category.",
        "0-50: Koss Porta Pro, KSC75, There are *tons* of IEMs in this price range that are excellent as well (CCA CRA, Final Audio E500, Moondrop quarks, and many others)50-150: HE400SE, HE-X4, DT770/990, SHP9500/9600150-200:HD560S,HD6XX,DT880200-350:r70x(my personal favorite), Sundara, DT 900 PRO X350-500: pretty much nothing lol maybe dt1990s500-1000:Focal Elex, LCD 2 Classic/Closed1000-2000:HD800/800S, LCD X, Focal Clear/Utopia, Hifiman Arya2000+: ZMF has tons of options in this range, theres also Hifiman Susvaras that are supposed to be amazing.$60,000 USD: Sennheiser HE-1",
        "$100, Probably akg k361's, nice headphones although they have their quirks.$200, He400se or hd560s. Very different options but both quite nice.$200-$500, Sundara's look pretty nice. I could be biased since I own anandas, though.At $600 I enjoy the Ananda, Love the stage on that headphone. Elex and LCD-2C's are very nice as well, lots of great options in this price range, imo.$1k-2k, Ultimately I'd have to say used He1kv2, they're too hard to pass up. A lot of hifiman picks, wow. Hd800s also look quite nice, and the Focal Radiance is absolutely stunning.For Over $2000, I gotta say, Meze empyreans/elites, or the Stabilized Vérité Closed. Just beautiful, very well built, and slightly fun headphones, while being resolving enough (for my ears), and not crazy demanding. **I would completely agree that they're probably not a great value for most people, and I wouldn't recommend them in most circumstances,** but personally, I'm a huge fan of the trio."
